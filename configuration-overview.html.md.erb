## <a id="monitoring-tas-from-within-foundation"></a> Monitoring TAS from within Foundation
In order to monitor a single TAS installation,
follow the instructions for
[Installing Healthwatch](../installing.html)
and the instructions for [Installing Healthwatch Exporter for TAS](../installing-exporter-tas-vms.html)
on the same foundation where TAS is installed.
**Healthwatch** will automatically detect
that the **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS** has also been installed
and will start scraping its metrics.

## <a id="monitoring-pks-from-within-foundation"></a> Monitoring PKS from within Foundation
In order to monitor a single PKS installation,
follow the instructions for
[Installing Healthwatch](../installing.html)
on the same foundation where PKS is installed.
**Healthwatch** will automatically detect
that the **Healthwatch Exporter for PKS** is also installed
and will begin scraping its metrics.

## <a id="monitoring-tas-and-pks"></a> Monitoring TAS and PKS
In order to monitor a foundation with both TAS and PKS installed,
follow the instructions for
[Installing Healthwatch](../installing.html),
the instructions for [Installing Healthwatch Exporter for TAS](../installing-exporter-tas-vms.html),
and the instructions for [Installing Healthwatch Exporter for PKS](../installing-exporter-pks.html),
on the same foundation where TAS and PKS are installed.
**Healthwatch** will automatically detect
that it is co-located with both **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS**
and **Healthwatch Exporter for PKS**
and will begin scraping both endpoints.


## <a id="monitoring-tas-from-the-control-plane"></a> Monitoring TAS from the Control Plane
The **Healthwatch** tile
can be used from the Control Plane
to monitor any number of TAS foundations.
To use **Healthwatch** in this way,
follow the installation instructions for
[Installing Healthwatch](../installing.html) on the control plane,
then follow the installation instructions for
[Installing Healthwatch Exporter for TAS](../installing-exporter-tas-vms.html)
on each TAS foundation you would like to monitor.

Once you have finished installing **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS** and completed the necessary
network configuration to expose the exporter VMs, add a scrape config to the **TSDB Configuration**
section of the **Healthwatch** tile in the Control Plane to scrape the exporter VMs. You
can get mTLS client credentials for this scrape config by grabbing the **TAS Exporter Client Mtls** credentials
from the **Credentials** tab of the  **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS** tile in Ops Manager. Your config
will look something like the following:

```yaml

## <a id="monitoring-pks-from-the-control-plane"></a> Monitoring PKS from the Control Plane
The **Healthwatch** tile can be used from the Control Plane to monitor any number of PKS
foundations. To use **Healthwatch** in this way, follow the installation instructions for
Installing Healthwatch the control plane, then follow the installation instructions for
Installing Healthwatch Exporter for PKS  on each PKS foundation you would like to monitor.

Once you have finished installing **Healthwatch Exporter for PKS** and completed the necessary
network configuration to expose the exporter VMs, add a scrape config to the **TSDB Configuration**
section of the **Healthwatch** tile in the Control Plane to scrape the exporter VMs. You
can get mTLS client credentials for this scrape config by grabbing the **Pks Exporter Client Mtls** credentials
from the **Credentials** tab of the  **Healthwatch Exporter for PKS** tile in Ops Manager. Your config
will look something like the following:

## <a id="allowlist-metrics"></a> Adding Metrics to an Allowlist
In some deployments,
it can be beneficial to only ingest certain metrics from a scrape job.
For example,
due to storage and cpu constraints,
an operator may only want to store SLI metrics for a foundation,
rather than the entirety of the Firehose.
The following example
shows how an operator could configure a scrape job
to only ingest gauge metrics with the names `some-metric` or `some-metric-2`.

```yaml
- job_name: allowlisted-job
  metric_relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: (some-metric|some-metric-2)
    action: keep
  metrics_path: /metrics

### <a id="monitoring-pks-master-nodes"></a> Monitoring PKS Master Nodes

When Healthwatch is installed on the same foundation as PKS,
it will automatically scrape the `kube-scheduler`
and `kube-controller-manager` processes on the Master VM.
More metrics (such as `etcd` metrics)
can be made available
by enabling the `TSDB_client` Telegraf output on the master VM.
To do that,
go to the **Monitoring** pane in the PKS tile,
and enter the following configuration in the `Setup Telegraf Outputs` section:

```toml
[[outputs.TSDB_client]]
  listen = ":9273"
```

This will expose additional metrics
on a `/metrics` endpoint on port `9273`.
In order to scrape these metrics,
add the following scrape configuration
to the **TSDB Configuration** pane of the Healthwatch tile:

```yaml
- job_name: cluster_master_telegraf
  dns_sd_configs:
    - names:
        - q-s4.master.*.*.bosh.
      type: A
      port: 9273
```

This example uses [Bosh DNS](https://bosh.io/docs/dns/)
to automatically discover all master VMs,
which now have Telegraf available on port `9273`.
