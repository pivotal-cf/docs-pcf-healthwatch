### Monitoring TAS from within Foundation
In order to monitor a single TAS installation, follow the instructions for 
Installing Healthwatch and the instructions
for [Installing Healthwatch Exporter for TAS  on
the same foundation where TAS is installed. **Healthwatch** will automatically detect that the 
**Healthwatch Exporter for TAS** has also been installed and will start scraping it's metrics.

### Monitoring PKS from within Foundation
In order to monitor a single PKS installation, follow the instructions for 
[Installing Healthwatch the same foundation
where PKS is installed. **Healthwatch** will automatically detect that the **Healthwatch Exporter for PKS**
is also installed and will begin scraping it's metrics.

### Monitoring TAS and PKS
In order to monitor a foundation with both TAS and PKS installed, follow the instructions for 
[Installing Healthwatch the instructions
for [Installing Healthwatch Exporter for TAS  on
the same foundation where TAS and PKS are installed. **Healthwatch** will automatically detect
that it is co-located with both **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS** and **Healthwatch Exporter for PKS** and 
will begin scraping both endpoints.


## Monitoring TAS from the Control Plane 
The **Healthwatch** tile can be used from the Control Plane to monitor any number of TAS 
foundations. To use **Healthwatch** in this way, follow the installation instructions for
[Installing Healthwatch he control plane, then follow the installation instructions for
[Installing Healthwatch Exporter for TAS  on each TAS foundation you would like to monitor.

Once you have finished installing **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS** and completed the necessary 
network configuration to expose the exporter VMs, add a scrape config to the **TSDB Configuration**
section of the **Healthwatch** tile in the Control Plane to scrape the exporter VMs. You
can get mTLS client credentials for this scrape config by grabbing the **TAS Exporter Client Mtls** credentials
from the *Credentials* tab of the  **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS** tile in Ops Manager. Your config
will look something like the following:

```yaml

## Monitoring PKS from the Control Plane

foundations. To use **Healthwatch** in this way, follow the installation instructions for

## Whitelisting Metrics 
In some deployments in can be beneficial to only ingest certain metrics from a scrape job.  For example, 
due to storage and cpu contraints an operator may only want to store SLI metrics for a foundation 
rather than the entirety of the Firehose.  The following example shows how an operatore
could configure a scrape job to only ingest gauge metrics with the names `some-metric` or `some-metric-2`. 
  
```yaml
- job_name: whitelisted-job
  metric_relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: (some-metric|some-metric-2)
    action: keep
  metrics_path: /metrics

### Monitoring PKS Master Nodes

When Healthwatch is installed on the same foundation as PKS, it will automatically scrape the `kube-scheduler`
and `kube-controller-manager` processes on the Master VM. More metrics (such as `etcd` metrics) can be made available
by enabling the `TSDB_client` Telegraf output on the master VM. To do that, go to the **Monitoring** tab in the
PKS tile, and enter the following configuration in the "Setup Telegraf Outputs" section:

```toml
[[outputs.TSDB_client]]
  listen = ":9273"
```

This will expose additional metrics on a `/metrics` endpoint on port `9273`. In order to scrape these metrics, add the
following scrape configuration to the **TSDB Configuration** section of the Healthwatch tile:

```yaml
- job_name: cluster_master_telegraf
  dns_sd_configs:
    - names:
        - q-s4.master.*.*.bosh.
      type: A
      port: 9273
```

This example uses [Bosh DNS][bosh-dns] to automatically discover all master VMs
which now have Telegraf available on port `9273`.

   1. Select **Enable** in the `Bosh Deployment Checker` section.
   1. Enter a BOSH UAA client and secret with an authority of `bosh.read`.
     <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In previous versions of Pivotal Healthwatch, the BOSH Deployment Checker used the BOSH Director admin credentials as default values. As of v1.3, the BOSH Deployment Checker defaults to disabled until configured.</p>
   1. Follow the instructions for [Creating UAA Clients for BOSH Director](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/opsmanager-create-bosh-client.html) to target the BOSH UAA and log in with an admin credential. Ensure that you are targeting the BOSH UAA and not Ops Manager or TAS UAA. If your BOSH Director is SSO-enabled, run the following command to log into the UAA:
     <pre class="terminal">uaac token sso get BOSH-DIRECTOR-UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-USERNAME</pre>
   1. Create a UAA Client for the Healthwatch BOSH task check using the following command:
     <pre class="terminal">uaac client add CLIENT-NAME --authorized\_grant\_types client\_credentials --authorities bosh.read --secret CLIENT-SECRET</pre>
  1. Click **Save**.
