This topic describes the architecture of the Healthwatch, Healthwatch Exporter for VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs), and Healthwatch
Exporter for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) tiles. This topic also describes the possible configurations for monitoring metrics across
multiple Ops Manager foundations.


## <a id='architecture-overview'></a> Overview of Healthwatch Architecture

There are three tiles that form the Healthwatch architecture: Healthwatch, Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs, and Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI.

A complete Healthwatch installation includes the Healthwatch tile, as well as at least one Healthwatch Exporter tile. However, you can deploy and use each
tile separately as part of an alternate monitoring configuration.

You must install a Healthwatch Exporter tile on each Ops Manager foundation you want to monitor. You can install the Healthwatch tile on the same Ops Manager
foundation or on a different Ops Manager foundation, depending on your desired monitoring configuration.

You can also configure the Healthwatch Exporter tiles to expose metrics to a service or database located outside your Ops Manager foundation, such as an
external time-series database (TSDB) or an installation of the Healthwatch tile on the TKGI Control Plane. This does not require you to install the
Healthwatch tile.

For a detailed explanation of the architecture for each tile, a list of open ports required for each component, and the possible configurations for monitoring
metrics across Ops Manager foundations, see the following sections:

* [Healthwatch Tile Architecture](#architecture-hw)

* [Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs Architecture](#architecture-tas)

* [Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI Architecture](#architecture-tkgi)

* [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)


## <a id='architecture-hw'></a> Healthwatch Tile Architecture

When you install the Healthwatch tile, Healthwatch deploys instances of Prometheus, Grafana, and MySQL. Healthwatch also deploys an Nginx proxy in front of
the Prometheus instance for load-balancing.

The Prometheus instance scrapes and stores metrics from the Prometheus endpoints on the metric exporter VMs that the Healthwatch Exporter tiles deploy.
Prometheus also allows you to configure alerts with Alertmanager.

Healthwatch then exports these metrics to dashboards in the Grafana UI, where you can visualize the data in charts and graphs. You can also use Grafana to
create customized dashboards for long-term monitoring and troubleshooting.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The MySQL instance that the Healthwatch tile deploys only stores your Grafana settings, and does not store any
  time-series data.</p>

The diagram below illustrates how metrics travel from the Healthwatch Exporter tiles through Prometheus and to Grafana. It also shows how metrics travel
through Prometheus to Alertmanager.

through Alertmanager to alerts. MySQL is next to Grafana.](images/healthwatch-tile-architecture.png)

### <a id='ha-mode'></a> High Availability

You can deploy the Healthwatch tile in high availability (HA) mode with three MySQL nodes and two MySQL Proxy nodes, or in non-HA mode with one MySQL node and
one MySQL Proxy node.

### <a id='scaling'></a> Component Scaling

Healthwatch deploys a single Grafana VM by default. If you need Grafana to be HA, you can scale the Grafana instance horizontally.

Healthwatch deploys two Prometheus VMs by default for HA, but supports a single Prometheus VM configuration as well. Further scaling
of Prometheus is accomplished by increasing disk size and can be configured in the Resource Config pane of the Healthwatch
tile. For more information, see [Configuring Healthwatch](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html).

### <a id='network-rules-hw'></a> Networking Rules for the Healthwatch Tile

The table below describes the ports you must open for each Healthwatch component:

## <a id='architecture-tas'></a> Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs Architecture

The **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs** tile deploys metric exporter VMs to generate each type of metric related to the health of your TAS for VMs
deployment.

Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs sends metrics through the Loggregator Firehose to a Prometheus exposition endpoint on the associated metric exporter VMs.
The Prometheus instance that exists within your metrics monitoring system then scrapes the exposition endpoints on the metric exporter VMs and imports those
metrics into your monitoring system.

You can scale the VMs that Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs deploys vertically, but should not scale them horizontally.

### <a id='network-rules-tas'></a> Networking Rules for Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs

The table below describes the ports you must open for each Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs component:

## <a id='architecture-tkgi'></a> Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI Architecture

The **Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI** tile deploys metric exporter VMs to generate SLIs related to the health of your TKGI deployment.

The Prometheus instance that exists within your metrics monitoring system then scrapes the Prometheus exposition endpoints on the metric exporter VMs and
imports those metrics into your monitoring system.

You can scale the VMs that Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI deploys vertically, but should not scale them horizontally.

### <a id='network-rules-tkgi'></a> Networking Rules for Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI

## <a id='configuration-options'></a> Configuration Options

Healthwatch can be configured in multiple ways, allowing you to monitor metrics across a variety of platform and foundation configurations. The sections below
describe the most common configuration scenarios:

* [Monitoring TAS for VMs on a Single Ops Manager Foundation](#tas-single-foundation)

* [Monitoring TKGI on a Single Ops Manager Foundation](#tkgi-single-foundation)

* [Monitoring TAS for VMs and TKGI on a Single Ops Manager Foundation](#tas-tkgi-single-foundation)

* [Monitoring TAS for VMs on a Different Ops Manager Foundation](#tas-different-foundation)

* [Monitoring TKGI on a Different Ops Manager Foundation](#tkgi-different-foundation)

### <a id='tas-single-foundation'></a> Monitoring TAS for VMs on a Single Ops Manager Foundation

If you only want to monitor a single Ops Manager foundation that has TAS for VMs installed, install the Healthwatch tile and Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for
VMs on the same foundation. The Healthwatch tile automatically detects Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs on the same Ops Manager foundation and adds a
scrape job for Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs to the Prometheus instance.

For more information about installing and configuring the Healthwatch tile and Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs, see the following topics:

* [Installing a Tile Manually](installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated Pipeline]
(installing/automated-pipeline.html)

* [Configuring Healthwatch](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html)

* [Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs](configuring/configuring-exporter-tas.html)

### <a id='tkgi-single-foundation'></a> Monitoring TKGI on a Single Ops Manager Foundation

If you only want to monitor a single Ops Manager foundation that has TKGI installed, install the Healthwatch tile and Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI on the
same foundation. The Healthwatch tile automatically detects Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI on the same Ops Manager foundation and adds a scrape job for
Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI to the Prometheus instance.

For more information about installing and configuring the Healthwatch tile and Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI, see the following topics:

* [Installing a Tile Manually](installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated Pipeline]
(installing/automated-pipeline.html)

* [Configuring Healthwatch](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html)

* [Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI](configuring/configuring-exporter-tkgi.html)

### <a id='tas-tkgi-single-foundation'></a> Monitoring TAS for VMs and TKGI on a Single Ops Manager Foundation

If you only want to monitor a single Ops Manager foundation that has both TAS for VMs and TKGI installed, install the Healthwatch tile, Healthwatch Exporter
for TAS for VMs, and Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI on the same foundation. The Healthwatch tile automatically detects Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs and
Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI on the same Ops Manager foundation and adds scrape jobs for both Healthwatch Exporter tiles to the Prometheus instance.

For more information about installing and configuring the Healthwatch tile, Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs, and Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI, see the
following topics:

* [Installing a Tile Manually](installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated Pipeline]

* [Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI](configuring/configuring-exporter-tkgi.html)

### <a id='tas-different-foundation'></a> Monitoring TAS for VMs on a Different Ops Manager Foundation

You can monitor several Ops Manager foundations that have TAS for VMs installed from a Healthwatch tile that you install on a separate Ops Manager foundation
or the TKGI Control Plane.

To configure your Healthwatch deployment to monitor several Ops Manager foundations from a single monitoring Ops Manager foundation or the TKGI Control Plane,
see [Configure Multi-Foundation Monitoring for TAS for VMs](configuring/multi-foundation-monitoring.html#multiple-tas-foundations) in _Configuring
Multi-Foundation Monitoring_.

### <a id='tkgi-different-foundation'></a> Monitoring TKGI on a Different Ops Manager Foundation

You can monitor several Ops Manager foundations that have TKGI installed from a Healthwatch tile that you install on a separate Ops Manager foundation or the
TKGI Control Plane. In order to do this, you must configure federation for your Healthwatch deployment.

To configure your Healthwatch deployment to monitor several Ops Manager foundations from a single monitoring Ops Manager foundation or the TKGI Control Plane
through federation, see [Configure Multi-Foundation Monitoring for TKGI](configuring/multi-foundation-monitoring.html#multiple-tkgi-foundations) in
_Configuring Multi-Foundation Monitoring_.
