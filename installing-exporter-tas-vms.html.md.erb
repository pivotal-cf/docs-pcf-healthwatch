    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Metric Sources use
    <strong>Healthwatch TAS Exporter</strong>
    to retrieve metrics from the
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/architecture.html">Reverse Log Proxy</a>.
    This includes all metrics flowing through the Firehose.
    For examples of metrics, see

##  (Optional) Scraping TAS Exporter Metrics

If you would like to scrape the TAS Exporter from off the foundation (for example, if you have installed a time series database (TSDB)
off of the foundation or are using the Healthwatch on the [Control Plane](../using.md))
then you will need to open network paths from the TSDB to the TAS Exporter VMs.  Instructions for doing so will differ 
depending on the IAAS being used.  In general, all that is needed is connectivity from the TSDB VM to the Exporter VMs
over TCP to the configured TAS Exporter Scrape Port (defaulted to 9090).
