title: Monitoring PCF Healthwatch
owner: PCF Healthwatch

This topic explains how to monitor the health of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch using the metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) generated by the service.

For general information about monitoring PCF, see [Monitoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/index.html).

## <a id="about-metrics"></a>About Metrics

PCF Healthwatch emits metrics in the following format:

<pre>
origin:"healthwatch" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1509638101820496694 deployment:"healthwatch-app-dev-v1-1" job:"healthwatch-forwarder" index:"097f4b1e-5ca8-4866-82d5-00883798dad4" ip:"10.0.16.29" valueMetric:&lt;name:"healthwatch.metrics.published" value:38 unit:"count"&gt;
</pre>

All PCF Healthwatch-emitted metrics have the `healthwatch` origin.

## <a id="keyPerformanceIndicators"></a>Key Performance Indicators for PCF Healthwatch

This section describes the KPIs that you can use to monitor the health of PCF Healthwatch.

###<a id="firehose-disconnect"></a>Number of Healthwatch Nozzle Disconnects from Firehose
<table>
   <tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"><br/> healthwatch.ingestor.disconnects<br/><br/></th></tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>
        Number of forced disconnects of the <a href="./architecture.html">PCF Healthwatch data ingestor nozzle</a> from the Firehose.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: An unusual increase in the number of disconnects from the Firehose typically indicates that you need to scale the nozzle up. The Firehose disconnects nozzles that are slow consumers to protect apps from backpressure. This metric can also spike during a PCF deployment because the Traffic Controller VMs restart, logging a disconnect.
        <br/><br/>
        A prolonged period of losing metrics as a result of disconnects can endanger the assessments that PCF Healthwatch makes using platform metrics from the Firehose.

        <strong>Type</strong>: Gauge<br/>

   <tr>

      <td>Average over last 5 minutes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended alert thresholds</th>
      <td>
        <strong>Yellow warning</strong>: Dynamic<br/>
        <strong>Red critical</strong>: Dynamic
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended response</th>
      <td>
        If no known deployment occurred and the spike is sustained, increase the number of PCF Healthwatch Ingestor instances and monitor this metric to ensure that it returns to a normal state.
        <br/><br/>
        You can scale Ingestor instances in the <strong>Healthwatch Component Config</strong> tab of the PCF Healthwatch tile or using the <code>cf scale healthwatch-ingestor</code> command. While <code>cf scale</code> helps you to quickly scale the instances, you should also update the tile configuration so that the next deployment does not override the manual scaling.
      </td>
   </tr>

###<a id="ingestor-dropped"></a>Number of Ingestor Dropped Metrics
<table>
   <tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"><br/> healthwatch.ingestor.dropped<br/><br/></th></tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>
        Number of dropped metrics from the Firehose at the <a href="./architecture.html">PCF Healthwatch data ingestor.</a><br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: An unusual increase in the number of dropped metrics typically indicates that either you need to scale Redis or there are some problems with the MySQL database.
        <br/><br/>
        A prolonged period of losing metrics can endanger the assessments that PCF Healthwatch makes using platform metrics from the Firehose.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Origin</strong>: Ingestor<br/>

###<a id="loader-dropped"></a>Number of Metrics Dropped by Healthwatch Data Loader
<table>

      <td>
        Number of metrics dropped by the <a href="./architecture.html">PCF Healthwatch data loader</a>, which loads incoming data into the PCF Healthwatch datastore.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: An unusual increase in the number of dropped metrics by the PCF Healthwatch Loader likely indicates that you need to scale this component up. A prolonged period of dropping metrics can endanger the assessments that PCF Healthwatch makes using platform metrics from the Firehose.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Origin</strong>: Firehose<br/>

      <td>
        Increase the number of PCF Healthwatch Loader instances and monitor this metric to ensure that it returns to a normal state.
        <br/><br/>
        You can scale Loader instances in the <strong>Healthwatch Component Config</strong> tab of the PCF Healthwatch tile or using the <code>cf scale healthwatch-loader</code> command. While <code>cf scale</code> helps you to quickly scale the instances, you should also update the tile configuration so that the next deployment does not override the manual scaling.

        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: Indicates that the Healthwatch UI is running and available to product users. While an issue with the UI does not impact the assessments that PCF Healthwatch is making, loss of the UI can impact user ability to visually reference these assessments.

        Metric values: 1 = available, 0 = not available, or timeout (10 s)
        <br/><br/>
        This assessment is made by looking for results within the configured test schedule plus timeout. For example, a test runner scheduled on 5-minute intervals with a 2-minute timeout must show a test result within the last 7 minutes to succeed.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: Indicates that PCF Healthwatch is assessing the health of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) commands. If these continuous validation tests fail to make up-to-date assessments, they are no longer a reliable warning mechanism.

        When monitoring this metric, the primary indicator of concern is an unexpected negative variance from the normal pattern of checks per test type. If an operator has not made changes that impact the number of checks being made, such as scaling the test runner or changing the frequency of the test, an unexpected variance from normal likely indicates problems in the test runner functionality.
