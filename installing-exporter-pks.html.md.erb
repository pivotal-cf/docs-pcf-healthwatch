    <strong>Note: </strong>
    Installing using Platform Automation
    by following config file for the <code>download-product</code>
    task will work to fetch the Healtwatch Exporter for PKS tile
    without getting Healtwatch or the TAS exporter:

pivnet-api-token: token
pivnet-file-glob: "Healthwatch-pks-*.pivotal"
pivnet-product-slug: p-healthwatch
product-version-regex: "0.4.*"
</pre>
</div>

##  Configure the Healtwatch Tile

To configure the Healtwatch Exporter for PKS tile, perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Healtwatch Exporter for PKS** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Assign AZs and Networks** and do the following:
    1. Select an Availability Zone (AZ) for placing singleton jobs.
    1. Select one or more AZs for balancing other jobs.
    1. Select **Network** for installing Healtwatch.
    1. Click **Save**.

1. *(Optional)* The exporter is defaulted to listen on port `9090`, to change, edit the value in the
   **PKS Exporter Configuration** section.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Metric Sources</p>
The Healtwatch PKS Exporter retrieves metrics from the [Bosh System Metrics Server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server-release).
This includes all of the typical Bosh metrics.  Examples of such metrics can be found here: [System (BOSH) metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/monitoring/kpi.html#bosh).

##  (Optional) Scraping PKS Exporter Metrics

If you would like to scrape the PKS Exporter from off the foundation (for example, if you have installed a Prometheus
off of the foundation or are using the Healtwatch on the [Control Plane](../using.md))
then you will need to open network paths from the Prometheus to the PKS Exporter VMs.  Instructions for doing so will differ
depending on the IAAS being used.  In general, all that is needed is connectivity from the Promethues VM to the Exporter VMs
over TCP to the configured PKS Exporter Scrape Port (defaulted to 9090).
