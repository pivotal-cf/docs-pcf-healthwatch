changes.

# Overview

The **Healthwatch** tile consists of a Time series database (TSDB), Grafana and MySQL. It is the place where metrics can 
be stored and visualized. The **Healthwatch Exporter for Tanzu Application Service** connects to the Loggregator RLP endpoint and funnels
the metrics to a TSDB exposition endpoint. Both of these tiles can be found under the **Healthwatch** 
product on VMware Tanzu Network. While the exporter must be installed on the foundation you wish to monitor, the **Healthwatch**
tile can be installed on the same foundation or on a different foundation depending upon your desired monitoring configuration. 
More information about possible configurations can be found in the section on Using Healthwatch.

# Architecture

When being used for multi-foundation monitoring, **Healthwatch** and it's exporters will commonly be
deployed as follows:

## Healthwatch

The **Healthwatch** tile installs three components: TSDB, Grafana and MySQL.  MySQL is used only to store the Grafana
settings and does not store any time series data. 

It can be deployed in high availability (HA) mode ( 3 MySQL nodes and 2 Proxy nodes) or in non-HA mode
(1 MySQL node and 1 Proxy node). Grafana may also be scaled horizontally beyond the default single VM. TSDB can be scaled
vertically but should not be scaled horizontally. An Nginx proxy is deployed in front of TSDB to provide authorization to
and encryption of metrics stored in TSDB.

## Healthwatch Exporter for Tanzu Application Service

The **Healthwatch Exporter for Tanzu Application Service** installs up to three VMs.  Each VM processes a metric type from the Firehose, either Timer, Gauge or Counter.
An operator can choose to deploy all three VMs or any subset thereof.  Metrics are then exposed on a secured TSDB
exposition format endpoints.  Theses VMs can be scaled vertically but should not be scaled horizontally.

## Healthwatch Exporter for PKS

The **Healthwatch Exporter for PKS** installs a single VM that collects health metrics from the Bosh Director. It follows a similar path as what was
done in TAS for VMs to get health metrics into the Firehose.  Metrics are then exposed on a secured TSDB exposition format endpoint.  This VM can be scaled
vertically but should not be scaled horizontally.
