## <a id='features'></a>About PCF Healthwatch

PCF Healthwatch is a service for monitoring and alerting on the current health, performance, and capacity of PCF. To help operators understand the operational state of their PCF deployment, PCF Healthwatch:

* Stores, visualizes and alerts on metrics from core PCF components, including BOSH-reported VM metrics. The service covers the recommended [Key Performance Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) for a given version of PCF.
* Executes health checks as continuous validation tests and creates super metrics. The service stores, displays, and forwards this data into the [Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose) for external consumption by existing customer solutions. For more information, see [PCF Healthwatch Metrics](metrics.html) and [Access Super Metrics Through the Firehose](using.html#firehose).

PCF Healthwatch stores all data points for 25 hours and then prunes them. Any active alerts that are pruned reissue an alert every 24 hours if the related metrics are not yet recovered to a normal state.
