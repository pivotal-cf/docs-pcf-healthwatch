title: Upgrading Healthwatch
owner: Healthwatch
---

This topic describes how to upgrade to Healthwatch&trade; for VMware Tanzu (Healthwatch).

Healthwatch uses the open-source components Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager to scrape, store, and view metrics, as well as configure alerts. This
architecture is entirely different from the architecture of Pivotal Healthwatch v1. Because of this, you must install Healthwatch as a new tile.

For more information about the differences between Healthwatch v2.2+ and Pivotal Healthwatch v1, see [Differences Between Healthwatch v2.2+ and Pivotal Healthwatch v1](#differences) below.

To upgrade to Healthwatch v2.2+ from Pivotal Healthwatch v1, see [Upgrade to Healthwatch v2.2](#upgrade) below.


## <a id='differences'></a> Differences Between Healthwatch v2.2+ and Pivotal Healthwatch v1

The following table explains the most significant differences between Healthwatch v2.2+ and Pivotal Healthwatch v1:

<table>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Architecture</td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthwatch v2.2:</strong> Uses the open-source components Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager to scrape, store, and view metrics, as
          well as configure alerts. Healthwatch v2.2+ deploys multiple Prometheus VMs by default to maintain high availability (HA), and you can scale other
          Healthwatch components to make them HA.</li>
        <li><strong>Pivotal Healthwatch v1:</strong> Consists of a dashboard and alerting system within the Pivotal Healthwatch v1 tile to monitor metrics and
          send alerts. If Pivotal Healthwatch v1 components become temporarily unavailable, Pivotal Healthwatch v1 relies on various other Tanzu Operations Manager tiles
          to buffer or queue metrics.</li>
      </ul>

          configure.</li>
        <li><strong>Pivotal Healthwatch v1:</strong> Uses the Pivotal Event Alerts service, through which you can subscribe to alerts for specific events
          using the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI).</li>

In addition to the updated features described in the table above, Healthwatch includes the following features:

* Runs a suite of service level indicator (SLI) tests to test the functionality of the TKGI API and collects metrics from those tests in the **TKGI Control
Plane** dashboard in the Grafana UI. For more information, see [TKGI SLI Exporter VM](metrics.html#pks-sli-exporter) in _Healthwatch Metrics_.

* Separates Diego capacity metrics by isolation segment in the **Diego/Capacity** dashboard in the Grafana UI.

* No longer displays metrics from BOSH smoke test deployments in the **Jobs** and **Job Details** dashboards in the Grafana UI.

* Allows you to include optional dashboards for the VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ for VMs (Tanzu RabbitMQ) and VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs (Tanzu SQL for VMs)
tiles in the Grafana UI.

* Allows you to monitor super value metrics (SVMs) that are similar to the super metrics generated in Pivotal Healthwatch v1.8 and earlier. For more
information about SVMs, see [Configure Prometheus](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#prometheus) in _Configuring Healthwatch_, [SVM Forwarder VM -
Healthwatch Component Metrics](metrics.html#svm-forwarder-components) in _Healthwatch Metrics_, and [SVM Forwarder VM - Platform
Metrics](metrics.html#svm-forwarder-platform) in _Healthwatch Metrics_.

* Automatically detects which version of TAS for VMs or TKGI is installed on your Tanzu Operations Manager foundation and creates the appropriate dashboard in the Grafana
UI.

* Allows you to use the Tanzu Operations Manager syslog forwarding feature to forward log messages from Healthwatch component VMs to an external destination for
troubleshooting, such as a remote server or external syslog aggregation service. For more information about how to configure syslog forwarding, see
[(Optional) Configure Syslog](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#syslog) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

## <a id='upgrade'></a> Upgrade to Healthwatch v2.2+

The architecture of Healthwatch v2.2+ is entirely different from the architecture of Pivotal Healthwatch v1. Because of this, you must install and configure
Healthwatch v2.2+ as a new tile even if you are upgrading from Pivotal Healthwatch v1. However, if you still rely on metrics from Pivotal Healthwatch v1, you
can keep Pivotal Healthwatch v1 installed and use it concurrently with Healthwatch v2.2+ while you transition to Healthwatch v2.2+.

To upgrade to Healthwatch:

1. Review the limitations and risks of using of Healthwatch. For more information about the limitations of Healthwatch v2.2, see [Healthwatch Limitations](index.html#healthwatch-limitations) in _Healthwatch for VMware Tanzu_. For more information about the risks of using Healthwatch, see
[Assumed Risks of Using Healthwatch](index.html#assumed-risks) in _Healthwatch for VMware Tanzu_.

1. Review the configuration options for Healthwatch to determine which tiles you must install on your Tanzu Operations Manager foundations. For more information, see
[Configuration Options](architecture.html#configuration-options) in _Healthwatch Architecture_.

1. Install the Healthwatch tile and Healthwatch Exporter tiles on the Tanzu Operations Manager foundations you want to monitor according to the configuration you
identified in the previous step, even if you have the Pivotal Healthwatch v1 tile installed already. For more information about installing the Healthwatch tile and Healthwatch Exporter tiles, see [Installing a Tile Manually](installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated Pipeline](installing/automated-pipeline.html).

1. Configure the Healthwatch component VMs through the Healthwatch tile and Healthwatch Exporter tile UIs in the Tanzu Operations Manager Installation Dashboard and
deploy the tiles. For more information about configuring and deploying the tiles, see [Configuring Healthwatch](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html),
[Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs](configuring/configuring-exporter-tas.html), and [Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for
TKGI](configuring/configuring-exporter-tkgi.html).

1. When you no longer need to use Pivotal Healthwatch v1, delete the Pivotal Event Alerts tile from your Tanzu Operations Manager foundations. Then, delete the Pivotal Healthwatch v1 tile from your Tanzu Operations Manager foundations.

    <p class="note important">
    You must delete the Pivotal Event Alerts tile before you delete the Pivotal Healthwatch v1 tile. If
    you delete the Pivotal Healthwatch v1 tile first, an error prevents you from deleting the Pivotal Event Alerts tile, and you must re-add the Pivotal
    Healthwatch v1 tile to delete the Pivotal Event Alerts tile.</p>

For more information about deleting tiles, see the [Tanzu Operations Manager documentation](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/tanzu-operations-manager/<%= vars.opsman_version %>/tanzu-ops-manager/install-add-delete.html#del-prod).
