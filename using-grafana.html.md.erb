This topic describes how to access and use yourHealthwatch&trade; for VMware Tanzu^&reg;^ v2.2 (Healthwatch) dashboards in the Grafana user interface (UI).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of Healthwatch Dashboards in the Grafana UI

Healthwatch uses Grafana to visualize metrics data in charts and graphs. Once you have installed and configured the Healthwatch and Healthwatch Exporter
tiles, you can log in to the Grafana UI to view dashboards that show how your Ops Manager foundations are performing.

Each dashboard contains charts and graphs called panels. Each dashboard and panel contains detailed descriptions of the metrics they display and how to
troubleshoot your Ops Manager foundations based on those metrics.


## <a id='ui'></a> Using Dashboards in the Grafana UI

The diagram below shows a dashboard in the Grafana UI:

![Screenshot of a dashboard in the Grafana UI with three white boxes labeled "A", "B", and "C" in red text. "A" is next to a filter dropdown. "B" is next to
an expandable "About" header. "C" is next to an icon containing a lowercase "i" in the upper left corner of a panel.](images/grafana-dashboard-diagram.png)

The following list describes each labeled section of the dashboard:

* **A - Filters:** Use these dropdowns to filter the metrics that the dashboard displays. Not all dashboards have filters.

* **B - Dashboard Header:** Click this header to see a description of the metrics that the dashboard displays, how to use those metrics for troubleshooting,
and links to further documentation.

* **C - Information Icon:** Hover over this icon to see a description of the metrics that the panel displays and how to use those metrics for troubleshooting.

You can edit a dashboard by copying the dashboard and editing the dashboard copy. To further customize your dashboards, see the [Grafana
documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/).


## <a id='view-dashboards'></a> View Your Healthwatch Dashboards

To view your Healthwatch dashboards:

1. In your web browser, navigate to the URL that you configured in the DNS entry for the Grafana instance. For more information, see [Configuring DNS for the
Grafana Instance](configuring/dns-configuration.html).

1. Follow one of the procedures below to log in to the Grafana UI, according to the authentication method you configured in the Healthwatch tile:
  * **Basic authentication:** To log in to the Grafana UI using basic authentication:
      1. Enter the following login credentials:
          * For **Email or username**, enter `admin`.
          * For **Password**, enter the password for the Grafana UI that you find in the Healthwatch tile. To find the password for the Grafana UI:
              1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
              1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.
              1. Select the **Credentials** tab.
              1. In the **Admin Login Password** row of the **Grafana** section, click **Link to Credential**.
              1. Record the value of `password`. This value is the password that all users must use to log in to the Grafana UI.
      1. Click **Log in**.

## <a id='dashboards'></a> Default Dashboards in the Grafana UI

There are 33 total dashboards that Healthwatch creates in the Grafana UI by default. The subsets of these dashboards that appear in the Grafana UI depend on

      Exporter for TAS for VMs cannot collect them. For more information, see the
      <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/6.0/tas-for-vms/metric-registrar-index.html">TAS for VMs documentation</a>.</p>
