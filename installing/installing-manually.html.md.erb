This topic describes how to manually install the Healthwatch for VMware Tanzu, Healthwatch Exporter for VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for
VMs), and Healthwatch Exporter for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) tiles.

To install, configure, and deploy these tiles through an automated pipeline, see [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated
Pipeline](automated-pipeline.html).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The Healthwatch tile monitors metrics across one or more Ops Manager foundations by scraping metrics from Healthwatch Exporter tiles installed on each
foundation. For more information about the architecture of each tile, see [Healthwatch Architecture](../architecture.html).

To manually install the Healthwatch and Healthwatch Exporter tiles, you must download and install the tiles from VMware Tanzu Network. For more information,
see [Install a Tile Manually](#install) below.

After you have installed the Healthwatch and Healthwatch Exporter tiles, you can configure them through the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. For more
information, see [Next Steps](#next-steps) below.

<p class="note">
There are risks to using Healthwatch v2.1, including missed email notifications, overwritten dashboards, and minor data
loss during upgrades. For more information about how to prepare for or prevent these problems, see <a href="../index.html#assumed-risks">Assumed Risks of
Using Healthwatch v2.1</a> in <em>Healthwatch</em>.</p>
