By default, Grafana is configured to use basic authentication with username `admin` and a generated password available
in the "Credentials" tab of the **Healthwatch** tile under `Grafana Login`. OAuth is another supported authentication
mechanism and can be enabled for multiple OAuth providers (UAA, GitHub, etc).

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Grafana Authentication Documentation </p> 
provides many ways to authenticate users. Some authentication integrations also enable syncing user permissions and org memberships. Visit [Grafana Authentication](https://grafana.com/docs/auth/overview/) for more assistance

## Configuring UAA OAuth
If you would like to specify UAA as your OAuth provider then select `UAA` as the authentication mechanism for Grafana
in the "Grafana Configuration" tab. Below is an example configuration for UAA.

To configure UAA as the OAuth identity provider, make sure to create a client for `grafana` with scopes
`openid,healthwatch.admin,healthwatch.edit,healthwatch.read`,
authorized grant type `authorization_code`, and a redirect URI pointing at the `
https://${ROOT_URL_FOR_GRAFANA}/login/generic_oauth`.

```bash
uaac client add grafana \
   --scope openid,healthwatch.admin,healthwatch.edit,healthwatch.read \
   --secret "$uper$ecret" \
   --authorities uaa.resource \
   --authorized_grant_types authorization_code \
   --redirect-uri http(s)://[GRAFANA ROOT URL]/login/generic_oauth
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>Make sure the protocol (http/https) in the redirect uri matches the protocol you choose to use. If you provide the SSL certificate in Grafana Configuration or put a load balancer with SSL termination in from of the Grafana, you should use https. GRAFANA ROOT URL should include port as well.</p>

## Configuring Generic OAuth
If you would like to configure any supported OAuth provider then select `Generic OAuth` as the authentication mechanism for the UI
in the "Grafana Configuration" tab. Below is an example configuration for GitHub.

To get the GitHub team ID you would like to use for authentication, you can run the following command. To find the slug
of your team, it is the last segment in the team's url in the browser (ie. `https://github.com/orgs/acme/teams/team_slug`).

```bash
curl --silent \
    --header "Authorization: bearer ${GITHUB_API_TOKEN}" \
    https://api.github.com/orgs/acme/teams/${GITHUB_TEAM_SLUG} | \
    jq -r .id
```

When setting up the GitHub OAuth application you will need to set the `Authorization callback URL` to
`https://${GRAFANA_ROOT_URL}/login/generic_oauth` where `GRAFANA_ROOT_URL` is the root URL of your Grafana instance.

## Configuring LDAP Authentication
If you would like to specify LDAP as your provider then select `LDAP` as the authentication mechanism for Grafana
in the "Grafana Configuration" tab. For individual field references, see [Grafana LDAP Authentication](https://grafana.com/docs/auth/ldap/).
