## <a id='releases'></a> Releases

### <a id='2-3-0'></a> v2.3.0

**Release Date:** June 15th, 2024

* **[Breaking Changes]** You will notice changes in the Healthwatch metrics when you start collecting metrics using the OpenTelemetry Collector. The changes you come across are listed below: 
    
  * Metrics from the Firehose-specific components, such as reverse log proxy, are not available after enabling the OpenTelemetry Collector. 
  * Currently, the OpenTelemetry Collector is collocated on TAS VMs and only collects metrics from these VMs. As a result, metrics from other tiles are not collected by the OpenTelemetry Collector. 
  * The Prometheus exporter in the OpenTelemetry Collector does not allow leading underscore, except in private metrics. Therefore, the OpenTelemetry Collector removes any leading underscores in metric names.
  * The SVM forwarder VM does not work with OpenTelemetry. You need to switch off the SVM forwarder VM if it is switched on.
  * The metrics listed in the table below have the  prefix `grafana` at the begining of the metric name when you use the OpenTelemetery Collector.
    
      | Metrics name with Firehose        | Metric name with the OpenTelemetery Collector |
      |-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
      | access_evaluation_duration_bucket | grafana_access_evaluation_duration_bucket     |
      | access_evaluation_duration_count  | grafana_access_evaluation_duration_count      |
      | access_evaluation_duration_sum    | grafana_access_evaluation_duration_sum        |
      | access_permissions_duration_bucket| grafana_access_permissions_duration_bucket    |
      | access_permissions_duration_count | grafana_access_permissions_duration_count     |
      | access_permissions_duration_sum   | grafana_access_permissions_duration_sum       |

* **[Feature]** Healthwatch 2.3.0 supports using the OpenTelemetry Collector (instead of Firehose) to collect metrics For more information, see [Configure for OpenTelemetry](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#opentelemetry). Once the OpenTelemetry Collector is configured, Healthwatch automatically switches
to collecting metrics from the OpenTelemetery Collector.

* **[Security Fix]** The following CVE was fixed by upgrading `Grafana` release version:
