## <a id='releases'></a> Releases

### <a id='2-3-0'></a> v2.3.0

**Release Date:** April 10, 2024

* **[Breaking Change]** Changes might be observed in Healthwatch metrics on switching to OTel collector for metric collection. All such changes have been described in
this section. Metrics that were coming from Firehose-specific components like reverse log proxy will not be available after enabling OTel collector. Currently the OTel
collector is collocated on TAS VMs and will only collect metrics from these VMs. As a result of this, metrics from other tiles will not be collected by the OTel collector. The
prometheus exporter in OTel collector does not allow leading underscore, except in private metrics. So the OTel collector is removing any leading underscores in metric
names. Also SVM forwarder VM will not work with otel and will have to be switched off if it is switched on.

* **[Feature]** Healthwatch 2.3.0 has support for using OTel collectors (instead of Firehose) for collecting metrics. For the steps for configuring OTel collector in
Healthwatch, see [Configure for OpenTelemetry](configuring-healthwatch.html#opentelemetry). Once OTel collector is configured, Healthwatch automatically switches
to collecting metrics from OTel collector.

* **[Feature]** Healthwatch 2.3.0 has been upgraded to Grafana 10, hence providing the new features offered by Grafana 10.

* **[Security Fix]** The following CVEs were fixed by upgrading `Grafana` release version:
[CVE-2023-49569](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49569)
