#### Active Locks Alert Threshold Changes When PAS Feature Disabled

**Disable Zero Downtime App Deployments** is an optional configuration in PAS v2.4 that changes the recommended alert threshold of the Active Locks KPI from `5` to `4`. For more information about the Active Locks KPI, see [Active Locks](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/monitoring/kpi.html#ActiveLocks).

This configuration is in the **Advanced Features** pane of the PAS tile. The corresponding manifest property is `advanced_features.properties.cloud_controller_temporary_disable_deployments`.

If you select **Disable Zero Downtime App Deployments** in the PAS tile, use the PCF Healthwatch API to update the alert threshold for active locks to a value of `4`. To do this, send the following API call:
    
```
"{\"query\":\"origin == 'locket' and name == 'ActiveLocks'\",\"threshold\":{\"critical\":4,\"type\":\"EQUALITY\"}}"
```

For more information, see [Update Alert Configurations](./api/alerts.html#post). 

#### Action Required when Changing Metrics Deployment Name in PAS Tile

PAS v2.4 introduces the the ability to uniquely identify metrics by tile. It uses `cf-GUID` as the value for `deployment`, which matches the BOSH deployment name. In PAS v2.3 and earlier, metrics have a `deployment` value of `cf`. The **Advanced Features** pane of the PAS tile includes a field to override this new feature and revert to previous behavior: **Use “cf” as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name**.

If you change the value of the **Use “cf” as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name** checkbox in PAS v2.4 tile, you must run the Healthwatch **Push Monitoring Components** errand. Healthwatch does not detect the change in PAS configuration unless you run this errand. 

For 24 hours after the configuration change, Healthwatch handles metric data in the following ways:

* Data emitted with the previous `cf` tag is treated as an Isolation Segment. 
* Data emitted with the new `cf-GUID` tag is treated as the default CF deployment.

During this window, use the Isolation Segment dropdown on the **Capacity** and **Routing** detail pages to view the data from before the configuration change. You can toggle between `cf` and `cf-GUID`.
