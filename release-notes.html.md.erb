## <a id='v1.6.3'></a>v1.6.3

**Release Date: September 17, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Remove metric, graph, and alert associated to [`Route Registration Messages Delta`](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/monitoring/kpi.html#route-registration). This metric was removed in PAS 2.4 so related graphs and alerts should not display. The current associated alert will be resolved automatically.
* **[Bug Fix]** Correctly handle [rotation of root Certificate Authorities](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).
* **[Bug Fix]** Correct the threshold for [Syslog Adapter Capacity](api/alerts.html#thresholds).
* **[Bug Fix]** Reduce noisiness of `system.healthy` alerts when a BOSH VM is created or deleted.
* **[Bug Fix]** If `healthwatch-ingestor` fails to receive data after 15 seconds, it will automatically reset its Spring Application Context to re-establish a Firehose connection. After 20 resets of the Spring Application Context, the app instance will purposely crash and let Diego re-schedule it, providing a fresh container and JVM instance.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fix `healthwatch-ingestor` crash in cases where GoRouter receives an HTTP request with non-standard HTTP method, resulting in a HttpStartStop metric with a null HTTP method value.
* **[Bug Fix]** Setting `Redis Worker Count` in the Healthwatch Component Config page of Ops Manager successfully changes
instance number. Previously, changes to this field were not reflected in the Healthwatch deployment.
* **[Bug Fix]** Delete orphaned `cf-health-check` `smoke-test-app` instances regularly. Previously, `cf-health-check` would occasionally fail
to delete a smoke test and never cleaned it up.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fix occasional inaccurate spikes in Log Transport Throughput graph.

* Maintenance update of the following dependencies:
  - Golang now 1.12.9
  - Java now 1.8.0_222-b10
  - Indicator Protocol now 0.7.16
  - Spring Boot now 2.1.7

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues.

#### Disk Slowly Fills When Using vSAN with Healthwatch Leads

The vSAN object count increases on vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2.

Healthwatch deploys the app `bosh-health-check`, which deploys and deletes a VM every 10 minutes. vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2 leave a namespace or folder and subfolders when a VM is deleted. The orphaned folders cause the vSAN object count to increase. This is a known issue for vSAN. For more information about the vSAN known issue, see [Deleted VMs leave components behind](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-vsphere-cpi-release/issues/165) in GitHub.

To address the issue, update vSphere to v6.5 update 2 or later. Or, stop the `bosh-health-check` to slow down the increase in vSAN object count.

#### Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard Displays Error Due to Log Cache

Occasionally, the Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard charts will fail to load with the following error: `"Error fetching graph data."`.

The Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard charts are populated using data from Log Cache, which is a component of Loggregator. The charts may fail to load if Log Cache times out while processing the data.

No corrective action is required. The issue will self-resolve if possible.

#### Multiple `healthwatch_space_developer` Users Created During Healthwatch Re-installation

When the PCF Healthwatch tile is re-installed, the `push-apps` errand creates a duplicate `healthwatch_space_developer` user because the pre-existing user is not deleted during 
the previous tile's deletion. 

This causes the `cf-health-check` to fail due to an invalid password for the `healthwatch_space_developer` user.

**Release Date: July 8, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes [Reverse Log Proxy Egress Dropped Messages Graph Not Displaying](./release-notes.html#rlp-egress-graph).
* **[Bug Fix]** The `Log Transport Dropped Egress Messages` graph correctly displays when all metrics are `0`.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues.

####<a id='cell-health-check-graph'></a> Cell Health Check graph is not showing correctly

On the Compute Performance page, the Cell Health Check graph shows no data. Upgrading to Healthwatch 1.6.3+ fixes this issue.
Alerting on the underlying metric, `rep.UnhealthyCell`, was unaffected.

####<a id='log-throughput-graph'></a> Occasional inaccurate spikes in Log Transport Throughput graph

The graph might spike inaccurately when doing a deployment upgrade or when the loggregator system is overloaded.

#### Disk Slowly Fills When Using vSAN with Healthwatch Leads

The vSAN object count increases on vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2.

Healthwatch deploys the app `bosh-health-check`, which deploys and deletes a VM every 10 minutes. vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2 leave a namespace or folder and subfolders when a VM is deleted. The orphaned folders cause the vSAN object count to increase. This is a known issue for vSAN.

No corrective action is required. The issue will self-resolve if possible.

#### Multiple `healthwatch_space_developer` CF on Healthwatch re-install

A user is created during the `push-apps` errand (which runs during tile installation) to be used during the `cf-health-check` test. This user was not being deleted on tile deletion, so if the tile is re-installed the `cf-health-check` fail because it's using an invalid password for the pre-existing `healthwatch_space_developer` user.

## <a id='v1.6.0'></a>v1.6.0

**Release Date: June 19, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Updates Healthwatch Charts with new features:
  * Drag a selection to zoom in.
  * Double click to zoom out.
  * More visibility around missing data.
  * Legend with filters.
* Renames Log Transport Dropped Messages chart to Log Transport Dropped Ingress Messages. The Log Transport Dropped Ingress Messages chart graphs the `doppler.dropped, direction: ingress` metric.
* Adds Log Transport Dropped Egress Messages chart on the Logging Performance page. This graphs the `doppler.dropped, direction: egress` metric. For more information about the Doppler Egress Dropped Messages KPI, see [Doppler Egress Dropped Messages](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#doppler-egress-dropped).
* PCF Healthwatch apps connect to the internal MySQL database using TLS.
* Increases logging around failed Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tests in the `cf-health-check` app.
* Binary log retention for internal MySQL database changed from 7 days to 2 days. This reduces the amount of persistent storage used by the VM.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes Log Transport Loss Rate alert markers rendering on multiple charts.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes Healthwatch Has Missing or Incorrect Data by more robustly determining the deployment tag.
* **[Bug Fix]** Diego Cell Capacity page graphs do not show false drops in capacity due to occasional late metric. Previously, if Diego emits a metric outside the standard one minute window, Diego Cell Capacity graphs show a false drop.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes Healthwatch Cannot Start if '0' aliased certificate is present in indicator keystore.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes regression where `opsman-health-check` doesn't work for self-signed Ops Manager certificate.
* **[Bug Fix]** BOSH Director stoplight correctly turns red when `bosh-health-check` fails.
* **[Bug Fix]** Correctly account for half-hour timezones in the Healthwatch UI.
* **[Bug Fix]** If `healthwatch-ingestor` fails to receive data after 15 seconds, it will automatically reset its Spring Application Context to re-establish a Firehose connection.

* Maintenance update of the following dependencies:
    - pxc-release now v0.15.0
    - Golang now v1.12.5
    - Indicator Protocol now v0.7.14
    - Spring Boot now 2.1.5
    - Flyway Command-line and Library now v5.2.4
    - Redis now v3.2.13
    - CF CLI now v6.45.0
    - Libraries Updated:

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues.

####<a id='log-throughput-graph'></a> Occasional inaccurate spikes in Log Transport Throughput graph

The graph might spike inaccurately when doing a deployment upgrade or when the loggregator system is overloaded.


####<a id='transport-dropped-egress-graph'></a> Log Transport Dropped Egress Messages Graph Not Displaying

If all values for `loggregator.doppler.dropped.egress` are 0, the `Log Transport Dropped Egress Messages` graph will not display.

This has been fixed in Healthwatch 1.6.1+.

####<a id='rlp-egress-graph'></a> Reverse Log Proxy Egress Dropped Messages Graph Not Displaying

If there are no `cf-syslog-drain` metrics emitted, the `Reverse Log Proxy Egress Dropped Messages` graph will not display.


#### Disk Slowly Fills When Using vSAN with Healthwatch Leads

The vSAN object count increases on vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2.

Healthwatch deploys the app `bosh-health-check`, which deploys and deletes a VM every 10 minutes. vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2 leave a namespace or folder and subfolders when the VM is deleted.

#### Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard Displays Error Due to Log Cache

Occasionally, the Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard charts will fail to load with the error: `"Error fetching graph data."`.

These charts are populated using Log Cache, which is part of Loggregator and will fail periodically due to Log Cache timing out while attempting to process the data.

No corrective action is required and it will self-resolve if possible.

#### Multiple `healthwatch_space_developer` CF on Healthwatch re-install

A user is created during the `push-apps` errand (which runs during tile installation) to be used during the `cf-health-check` test. This user was not being deleted on tile deletion, so if the tile is re-installed the `cf-health-check` fail because it's using an invalid password for the pre-existing `healthwatch_space_developer` user.
