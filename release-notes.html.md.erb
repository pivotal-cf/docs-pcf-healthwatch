This topic contains release notes for Healthwatch for VMware Tanzu v2.0.6 and v2.1.

<p class="note">
Healthwatch v2.0.6 is a beta version that is no longer available for download. VMware does not recommend using
Healthwatch v2.0.6 in production environments.</p>

The architecture of Healthwatch v2.1 is entirely different from the architecture of Pivotal Healthwatch v1. Healthwatch v2.1 uses the open-source components
Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager to scrape, store, and view metrics, as well as configure alerts. For more information about the differences between
Pivotal Healthwatch v1 and Healthwatch v2.1 and how to upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1, see [Upgrading Healthwatch](upgrading-healthwatch.html).

## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

To upgrade from Pivotal Healthwatch v1 to Healthwatch v2.1, see [Upgrading Healthwatch](upgrading-healthwatch.html).


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features

Healthwatch v2.0.6 and v2.1 include the following major features:

### <a id='tas-support'></a> Healthwatch Supports TAS for VMs v2.12 and Earlier

You can use Healthwatch to monitor TAS for VMs v2.12 and earlier.

Your TAS for VMs dashboards in the Grafana UI update automatically to display TAS for VMs v2.12 metrics unless you manually set the dashboard version when you
configure the Grafana VM. For more information about setting the TAS for VMs version for your dashboards, see [Configure
Grafana](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#grafana) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

### <a id='tkgi-support'></a> Healthwatch Supports TKGI v1.12 and Earlier

You can use Healthwatch to monitor TKGI v1.12 and earlier.

Your TKGI dashboard in the Grafana UI updates automatically to display TKGI v1.12 metrics unless you manually set the dashboard version when you configure the
Grafana VM. For more information about setting the TGKI version for your dashboards, see [Configure Grafana](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#grafana)
in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

### <a id='assign-static-ips'></a> Assign Static IP Addresses to Prometheus VMs

You can assign static IP addresses to your Prometheus VMs.

If you configure email alerts through Alertmanager, you may need to add the IP addresses of your Prometheus VMs to your Ops Manager allowlist so your SMTP
server does not block them. You can then view the IP addresses of your Prometheus VMs using the BOSH CLI.

For more information about assigning IP addresses to your Prometheus VMs, see [(Optional) Configure
Prometheus](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#prometheus) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

### <a id='event-alerts'></a> Healthwatch Replaces Event Alerts With Alertmanager

Healthwatch v2.1 uses Alertmanager, an open-source Prometheus component, to manage and send alerts according to the alerting rules you configure. Pivotal
Healthwatch v1 used Pivotal Event Alerts for managing alerts, which Healthwatch v2.1 does not support.

For more information about configuring alerts, see [Configuring Alerting](configuring/optional-config/alerting.html).

### <a id='indicator-protocol'></a> Healthwatch Removes Monitoring Indicator Protocol

Healthwatch no longer supports Monitoring Indicator Protocol, and the **Indicator Protocol** dashboard is removed from the Grafana UI.

This change does not affect VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ for VMs (Tanzu RabbitMQ) metrics and dashboards.


## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes

Healthwatch v2.0.6 and v2.1 includes the following breaking changes:

### <a id='metric-uniqueness'></a> Certificate Expiration Metrics Have Additional Tags

The `ssl_certificate_expiry_seconds` metric has additional tags to ensure that each metric is unique. The addition of these tags does not change any metric
names.

### <a id='self-signed-certs'></a> Self-Signed Certificates Break Dashboards

While Pivotal Healthwatch v1 does not require TLS verification for Ops Manager certificates, Healthwatch v2.1 checks for TLS certificate verification by
default. If your Ops Manager deployment uses self-signed certificates, you must configure the Healthwatch tile to skip TLS certificate verification.

If the **Ops Manager Health** dashboard in the Grafana UI displays a "Not Running" error, activate the **Skip TLS certificate verification** checkbox in the
**Canary URLs** pane of the Healthwatch tile. For more information about configuring this checkbox, see [(Optional) Configure Canary
URLs](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#canary) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

If your **Certificate Expiration** dashboard displays "N/A" or you see errors in your certificate expiration metric logs, activate the **Skip TLS certificate
verification** in the **TAS for VMs Metric Exporter VMs** pane of the Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs tile or the **TKGI Metric Exporter VMs** pane of
the Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI tile. For more information about configuring this checkbox, see [(Optional) Configure TAS for VMs Metric Exporter
VMs](configuring/configuring-exporter-tas.html#exporter-config) in _Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs_ or [(Optional) Configure TKGI and
Certificate Expiration Metric Exporter VMs](configuring/configuring-exporter-tkgi.html#exporter-config) in _Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI_.


## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

Healthwatch v2.0.6 and v2.1 include the following known issues:

### <a id='install-failure'></a> Healthwatch Fails to Install on Ops Manager v2.10.19 and Later

This known issue is fixed in Healthwatch v2.1.5.

If you are using Ops Manager v2.10.19 or later, Healthwatch fails to install. Attempting to install Healthwatch causes the following errors:

```

- Error filling in template 'alerting.rules.yml.erb' (line 33: undefined method \`escape' for URI:Module)
```

To fix this issue, upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1.5.

### <a id='svm-metrics'></a> SVM Forwarder VM Does Not Initially Forward SVMs

This known issue is fixed in Healthwatch v2.1.4 and later.

The SVM Forwarder VM does not forward SVMs to the Loggregator Firehose after the first time it deploys.

To fix this issue, restart the SVM Forwarder VM by running:

```
monit restart svm-formwarder
```

### <a id='scaled-vms'></a> Scaled VMs Not Distributed Across AZs by Default

This known issue is fixed only for new installations of Healthwatch v2.1.1 and later. If you upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1.1 from Healthwatch v2.1.0 or earlier,
this known issue still exists.

If you scale Healthwatch component VMs up, they are not automatically distributed across AZs. To distribute them evenly across AZs, you must scale the VMs
down, then scale them back up.

For more information about scaling Healthwatch component VMs, see [Healthwatch Components and Resource Requirements](resources.html).

### <a id='upgrade-from-om-23'></a> "Unable to Render Templates" Error When Installing or Upgrading

This known issue is fixed in Ops Manager v2.8 and later.

When installing or upgrading to Healthwatch v2.1, you could see the following error:

<pre class="terminal">
- Unable to render templates for job 'opsman-cert-expiration-exporter'. Errors are:
  - Error filling in template 'bpm.yml.erb' (line 9: Can't find property '["opsman_access_credentials.uaa_client_secret"]')
</pre>

This error occurs if you upgraded from Ops Manager v2.3 or earlier to Ops Manager v2.4 through v2.7.

For more information about how to fix this issue without upgrading to Ops Manager v2.8, see ["Unable to Render Templates" Error When Installing or
Upgrading](troubleshooting.html#upgrade-from-om-23) in _Troubleshooting Healthwatch_.

### <a id='alert-receiver-basic-auth'></a> Missing Username Field in Alert Receiver Basic Authentication Configuration

This known issue is fixed in Healthwatch v2.1.4 and later.

In Healthwatch v2.1.3 and earlier, you cannot configure basic authentication credentials for PagerDuty, Slack, or webhook alert receivers because the field to
configure a username is missing.

To fix this issue, upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1.4 or later.

### <a id='bosh-health-401'></a> BOSH Health Metric Exporter VM Causes 401 Error

This known issue is fixed in Healthwatch v2.1.1 and later.

If you re-install the Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs tile, the BOSH health metric exporter VM does not always delete the BOSH deployment it creates,
`bosh-health`. This causes the following error:

<pre class="terminal">
Director responded with non-successful status code '401' response
'{"code":600000,"description":"Require one of the scopes: bosh.admin,
bosh.750587e9-eae5-494f-99c4-5ca429b13959.admin,
bosh.teams.p-healthwatch2-pas-exporter-b3a337d7ec4cca94f166.admin"}'
</pre>

To fix this issue, upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1.1 or later or manually delete the `bosh-health` deployment using the BOSH CLI. For more information about
upgrading to Healthwatch v2.1.1, see [Upgrading Healthwatch](upgrading-healthwatch.html). For more information about deleting a BOSH deployment using the BOSH
CLI, see [the BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/#delete-deployment).

### <a id='no-data-nodes-tkgi-112'></a> No Data for containerd Clusters on Kubernetes Nodes Dashboard for TKGI v1.12 and Later

This known issue is fixed in Healthwatch v2.2.2 and later.

If you have TKGI v1.12 or later installed, the **Kubernetes Nodes** dashboard in the Grafana UI might not show data for Kubernetes clusters that use the
containerd runtime.

In TKGI v1.11 and earlier, the `name` label in Kubernetes cluster metrics start with `k8s_`. However, in TKGI v1.12 and later, new Kubernetes clusters run on
containerd instead of in Docker. As a result, in TKGI v1.12 and above the `name` label in Kubernetes cluster metrics start with a hex value instead of `k8s_`,
which the Grafana instance does not recognize.

To fix this issue, upgrade to Healthwatch v2.2.2 or later. For more information about upgrading to Healthwatch v2.2, see [Upgrading
Healthwatch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Healthwatch-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.2/healthwatch/upgrading-healthwatch.html).

### <a id='no-data-nodes-tkgi-110'></a> No Data on Kubernetes Nodes Dashboard for TKGI v1.10

If you are using TKGI v1.10.0 or v1.10.1, the **Kubernetes Nodes** dashboard in the Grafana UI might not show data for individual pods. This is due to a known
issue in Kubernetes v1.19.6 and earlier and Kubernetes v1.20.1 and earlier.

To fix this issue, upgrade to TKGI v1.10.2 or later. For more information about upgrading to TKGI v1.10.2 or later, see the [TKGI
documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.4/tkg-deploy-mc/mgmt-upgrade-index.html).

### <a id='tkgi-windows-clusters'></a> No Data on Kubernetes Nodes Dashboard for Windows Clusters

If you are using TKGI to monitor Windows clusters, the **Kubernetes Nodes** dashboard in the Grafana UI might not show data. Healthwatch does not currently
visualize node metrics for Windows clusters.

### <a id='mysql-proxy-maxed'></a> MySQL Proxy Disk Space Fills Up Quickly

This known issue is fixed in Healthwatch v2.1 and later.

In Healthwatch v2.0.6, the MySQL PXC instance stores too many binlogs, which fills up the persistent disk space for MySQL Proxy VMs at a faster rate.

To fix this issue, upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1. For more information about upgrading to Healthwatch v2.1, see [Upgrading
Healthwatch](upgrading-healthwatch.html).

### <a id='tkgi-service-accounts'></a> Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI Does Not Clean Up TKGI Service Accounts

This known issue is fixed in Healthwatch v2.1.9 and later.

If you run SLI tests for TKGI through Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI, and you do not have an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider for your Kubernetes clusters
configured for TKGI, the TKGI SLI exporter VM does not automatically clean up the service accounts that it creates while running the TKGI SLI test suite.

To fix this issue, either upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1.9 or configure an OIDC provider as the identity provider for your Kubernetes clusters in the TKGI tile.
This cleans up the service accounts that the TKGI SLI exporter VM creates in future TKGI SLI tests, but does not clean up existing service accounts from
previous TKGI SLI tests. For more information about configuring an OIDC provider in TKGI, see the [TKGI
documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.4/tkg-deploy-mc/mgmt-iam-index.html).

You may need to manually delete existing service accounts from previous TKGI SLI tests. For more information, see
[Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI Does Not
Clean Up TKGI Service Accounts](troubleshooting.html#tkgi-service-accounts) in _Troubleshooting Heathwatch_.

### <a id='bbr-backups-tsdb'></a> BBR Backup Snapshots Fill Disk Space on Prometheus VMs

This known issue is fixed in Healthwatch v2.1.9 and later.

In Healthwatch v2.1.8 and earlier, the backup scripts for Prometheus VMs do not clean up the intermediary snapshots created by BBR. This results in the disk
space on Prometheus VMs filling up.

To fix this issue, either upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1.9 or manually clean up the snapshots. To manually clean up the snapshots, see [BBR Backup Snapshots Fill
Disk Space on Prometheus VMs](troubleshooting.html#bbr-backups-tsdb) in _Troubleshooting Healthwatch_.
