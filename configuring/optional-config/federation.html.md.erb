This topic describes how to configure federation for your Healthwatch for VMware Tanzu installation.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of Federation

Healthwatch supports federation. When you configure your Healthwatch installation to federate metrics, the Prometheus instance in the Healthwatch tile on a
monitoring Ops Manager foundation, scrapes a subset of metrics from the Prometheus instances in the Healthwatch tiles installed on the Ops Manager foundations
you monitor. This is useful if you want to monitor a subset of metrics from multiple Ops Manager foundations without storing all metrics from those Ops Manager
foundations in a single Prometheus instance. As federation allows for filtering of the scraped metrics, it preferred over directly scraping metrics in order to
monitor a large number of Ops Manager foundations without overwhelming monitoring Prometheus.

To configure federation for your Healthwatch installation, install the Healthwatch tile on your monitoring foundation and on each foundation you want to
monitor, in addition to installing the Healthwatch Exporter tile on each foundation you want to monitor. Then, configure the Healthwatch tile on your
monitoring foundation to federate metrics from the Prometheus installed on the foundations you want to monitor.

For more information about federation, see the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/).

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> Storing all Loggregator Firehose metrics from more than one large TAS for VMs foundation in a single
  Prometheus instance negatively affects the performance of that Prometheus instance, sometimes even causing it to crash. To avoid this, VMware recommends
  federating only service level indicator (SLI) metrics from each foundation you want to monitor to the Prometheus instance in your monitoring foundation.
  For more information about SLI metrics for TAS for VMs, see <a href="../../metrics.html#pas-sli-exporter">TAS for VMs SLI Exporter VM</a> in <em>Healthwatch
  Metrics</em>.</p>


## <a id='federation-config'></a> Configure Federation

To configure federation your Healthwatch installation:

1. Install the Healthwatch tile on the foundation you use to monitor other foundations, such as an Ops Manager foundation. For more
information, see [Installing a Tile Manually](../../installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an
Automated Pipeline](../../installing/automated-pipeline.html).

1. Install the Healthwatch tile and either the Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs tile or the Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI tile on each foundation you want
to monitor. For more information, see [Installing a Tile Manually](../../installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a
Tile Through an Automated Pipeline](../../installing/automated-pipeline.html).

1. For each foundation you want to monitor, open port `4450` in your IAAS for the Prometheus instance in the Healthwatch tile.

1. For each foundation you want to monitor:
  1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard for the foundation you want to monitor.
  1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.
  1. Select the **Credentials** tab.
  1. In the **Promxy Client Mtls** row of the **TSDB** section, click **Link to Credential**.
  1. Record the values of `private_key_pem` and `cert_pem`. These values are the private key and certificate for **Promxy Client mTLS**.
  1. Retrieve the certificate for the Ops Manager root certificate authority (CA) of the foundation you want to monitor. For more information, see the [Ops
  Manager documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/security/pcf-infrastructure/managing-certificates.html#root-certs).
  1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard for your monitoring foundation.
  1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.
  1. Select **Prometheus**.
  1. Under **Additional scrape jobs**, click **Add**.
  1. For **Scrape job configuration parameters**, provide in YAML format the configuration parameters for a scrape job for the Prometheus instance in the
  Healthwatch tile on the foundation you want to monitor. In the example below, the scrape job federates all metrics with names that match the regular
  expression `^metric_name_regex.*` from the Prometheus instance at the IP address listed under the `targets` property:

        ```
        job_name: example-job-name
        scheme: https
        metrics_path: '/federate'
        params:
          'match[]':
            - '{__name__=~"^metric_name_regex.*"}'
        static_configs:
          - targets:
            - 'source-tsdb-1:4450'
            - 'source-tsdb-2:4450'
        ```
        <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you have configured a load balancer or DNS entry for the Prometheus instance, include the IP address for
          your load balancer or DNS entry in each target listed under the <code>targets</code> property instead of the IP address for the Prometheus
          instance.</p>
  1. For **Certificate and private key for TLS**, enter the certificate and private key you recorded from the **Promxy Client mTLS** row in the
  **Credentials** tab in the Healthwatch tile installed on the foundation you want to monitor in a previous step.
  1. For **CA certificate for TLS**, enter the Ops Manager root CA certificate for the foundation you want to monitor that you recorded in a previous step.
  1. For **Target server name**, enter `promxy`.
  1. Click **Save**.

    If you are using the `om` CLI to configure the Healthwatch tile, the example below shows how you would enter the example configuration parameters above in
    an automation script:
    <%= partial '../../snippets/federation.md' %>
    For more information, see [Configure and Deploy Your Tile Using the om CLI](../../installing/automated-pipeline.html#om) in _Installing, Configuring, and
    Deploying a Tile Through an Automated Pipeline_.

  For more information about configuring scrape jobs, see [Configure Prometheus](../configuring-healthwatch.html#prometheus) in _Configuring Healthwatch_ and
  the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config).


## <a id='ha'></a> Federation for a Highly Available Healthwatch Deployment

In a highly available (HA) Healthwatch deployment, each VM in the Prometheus instance in the Healthwatch tile scrapes the same data from the metric exporter
VMs that the Healthwatch Exporter tiles deploy.

When federating metrics, you can configure the Prometheus instance in the Healthwatch tile on your monitoring foundation to scrape both copies of that data
from the Prometheus instance in the Healthwatch tile on each foundation you monitor. To do this, include both VMs in each Prometheus instance from the
foundations you want to monitor in the scrape job configuration parameters. While including both VMs creates duplicate sets of metrics, it also ensures that
you do not lose metric data if one of the two VMs goes down. However, this will negatively affect the performance of Prometheus as the number of scraped metrics
is doubled.

Alternatively, you can create load balancers or DNS entries in your IaaS console for the Prometheus instances on each foundation you monitor, then include the
IP addresses for each load balancer or DNS entry in the targets listed under the `targets` property in your scrape job configuration parameters. For more
information, see [Configure Federation](#federation-config) above.

In both cases, VMware recommends configuring static IP addresses for both VMs in each of the Prometheus instances. For more information about configuring
static IP addresses for Prometheus instances, see [Configure Prometheus](../configuring-healthwatch.html#prometheus) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.
