This topic describes how to configure authentication with a User Account and Authentication (UAA) instance on a different VMware Tanzu Operations Manager&trade; foundation for users to log in to the Grafana UI.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of UAA Authentication with the Grafana UI

Healthwatch&trade; for VMware Tanzu (Healthwatch) can automatically configure authentication with the UAA instance of the runtime that is installed on the same Tanzu Operations Manager
foundation as the Healthwatch tile, either VMware <%= vars.runtime_prod_full %> or VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid&trade; Integrated Edition (TKGI). When you
select **UAA** as your Grafana UI authentication method in the **Grafana Authentication** pane of the Healthwatch tile, Healthwatch automatically configures
authentication with the UAA instances in <%= vars.runtime_prod_full %> and TKGI for the Grafana UI.

If you want to configure authentication with the UAA instance of a runtime that is installed on a different Tanzu Operations Manager foundation, you must select **Generic
OAuth** and configure it manually through the **Grafana Authentication** pane.


## <a id='create-uaa-client'></a> Create a UAA Client for the Grafana Instance

To authenticate with the the UAA instance of a runtime that is installed on a different Tanzu Operations Manager foundation, the Grafana instance must access the UAA
instance through a UAA client.

To create a UAA client for the Grafana instance:

1. Navigate to the Tanzu Ops Manager Installation Dashboard for the Tanzu Operations Manager foundation with the UAA instance with which you want to configure authentication for
the Grafana UI.

1. Click the **VMware <%= vars.runtime_prod_full %>** or **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition** tile, depending on which runtime is installed on this Tanzu Operations
Manager foundation.

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.

1. View and record the credentials to log in to the UAA instance for the runtime installed on this Tanzu Operations Manager foundation:
    * For <%= vars.runtime_prod_full %>:

        1. In the **Admin Client Credentials** row of the **UAA** section, click **Link to Credential**.
        1. Record the value of `password`. This value is the secret for **Admin Client Credentials**.

    * For TKGI:

        1. In the **Pks Uaa Management Admin Client** row, click **Link to Credential**.
        1. Record the value of `secret`. This value is the secret for **Pks Uaa Management Admin Client**.

1. Target the server for the UAA instance for the runtime installed on this Tanzu Operations Manager foundation using the User Account and Authentication Command Line
Interface (UAAC). Run:

    ```
    uaac target UAA-URL
    ```

    Where `UAA-URL` is the URL of the UAA instance with which you want to configure authentication. For UAA instances for <%= vars.runtime_prod_short %>, this URL is usually
    `https://login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`, where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the domain you configured in the **System domain** field in the **Domains** pane of the <%= vars.runtime_prod_full %> tile. For TKGI, this URL is usually `https://TKGI-API-URL:8443`, where `TKGI-API-URL` is the URL of the TKGI API.
    <br>
    <br>
    For more information about the UAAC, see the [<%= vars.runtime_prod_full %> documentation](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/tanzu-platform-for-cloud-foundry/<%= vars.runtime_version %>/tpcf/uaa-user-management.html).

1. Log in to the UAA instance by running:

    ```
    uaac token client get admin -s UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```

    Where `UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET` is the UAA administrator client secret you recorded from the **Credentials** tab in the runtime tile in a previous step.

2. Create a UAA client for the Grafana instance by running:

    ```
    uaac client add grafana \
       --scope openid,healthwatch.admin,healthwatch.edit,healthwatch.read \
       --secret CLIENT-SECRET \
       --authorities uaa.resource,refresh_token \
       --authorized_grant_types authorization_code \
       --redirect_uri PROTOCOL://GRAFANA-ROOT-URL/login/generic_oauth
    ```

    Where:

    * `CLIENT-SECRET` is the secret you want to set for the UAA client.
    * `PROTOCOL` is either `http` or `https`, depending on the protocol you configured the Grafana instance to use in the **Grafana** pane of the Healthwatch
    tile.
    * `GRAFANA-ROOT-URL` is the root URL for the Grafana instance that you use to access the Grafana UI.

3. If you are using TKGI, you must manually create UAA user groups to map to administrator, editor, and viewer permissions for Grafana. Run:

    ```
    uaac group add healthwatch.admin
    uaac group add healthwatch.edit
    uaac group add healthwatch.read
    ```

    If you are using <%= vars.runtime_prod_short %>, you added the UAA client to UAA user groups mapped to administrator, editor, and viewer permissions for Grafana in the
    previous step. Continue to the next step.

4. Create a user account for the UAA client you created in a previous step to log in to the Grafana instance. Run:

    ```
    uaac user add USERNAME -p SECRET --emails EMAIL
    ```

    Where:

    * `USERNAME` is the username you want to set for the user account.
    * `SECRET` is the secret you want to set for the user account.
    * `EMAIL` is the email address you want to associate with the user account.

5. Assign user permissions to the user account you created in the previous step by running:

    ```
    uaac member add GROUP USERNAME
    ```

    Where:

    * `GROUP` is either `healthwatch.admin`, `healthwatch.edit`, or `healthwatch.read`. These groups map to the `Admin`, `Editor`, and `Viewer` Grafana roles,
    respectively. For more information about the level of access each role provides, see the [Grafana
    documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/permissions/organization_roles/#compare-roles).
    * `USERNAME` is the username you set for the user account you created in the previous step.


## <a id='configure-external-uaa'></a> Configure the Grafana UI

To configure the Grafana UI to authenticate users with a UAA instance on a different Tanzu Operations Manager foundation:

1. Navigate to the Tanzu Ops Manager Installation Dashboard for the Tanzu Operations Manager foundation with the Grafana instance for which you want to configure UAA
authentication.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.

1. Select **Grafana Authentication**.

1. Under **Additional authentication methods**, select **Generic OAuth**.

1. For **Provider name**, enter a name that identifies the UAA instance with which you want to configure authentication. For example, `UAA`.

1. For **Client ID**, enter the client ID of the UAA client that was created for the UAA instance with which you want to configure authentication in [Create a
UAA Client for the Grafana Instance](#create-uaa-client) above.

1. For **Client secret**, enter the client secret of the UAA client that was created for the UAA instance with which you want to configure authentication in
[Create a UAA Client for the Grafana Instance](#create-uaa-client) above.

1. For **Scopes**, enter `openid,healthwatch.admin,healthwatch.edit,healthwatch.read`.

1. For **Authorization URL**, enter the authorization URL for your runtime:
    * For <%= vars.runtime_prod_short %>, enter `https://login.sys.DOMAIN/oauth/authorize`, where `DOMAIN` is the system domain of your Tanzu Operations Manager deployment.
    * For TKGI, enter `https://api.pks.DOMAIN:8443/oauth/authorize`, where `DOMAIN` is the system domain of your Tanzu Operations Manager deployment.

1. For **Token URL**, enter the token URL for your runtime:
    * For <%= vars.runtime_prod_short %>, enter `https://login.sys.DOMAIN/oauth/token`, where `DOMAIN` is the system domain of your Tanzu Operations Manager deployment.
    * For TKGI, enter `https://api.pks.DOMAIN:8443/oauth/token`, where `DOMAIN` is the system domain of your Tanzu Operations Manager deployment.

1. For **API URL**, enter `http://localhost:3002/userinfo`. This is the URL of a local proxy server that Healthwatch can use to translate the UAA token into a
format that is compatible with Grafana.

1. To allow new users to create a new Grafana account when they log in with their existing UAA credentials for the first time, activate the **Allow new
accounts with existing OAuth credentials** checkbox. This checkbox is activated by default. Deactivating this checkbox prevents users without a pre-existing
Grafana account from creating a new Grafana account or logging in to the Grafana UI with their existing UAA credentials.

1. For **Role attribute path**, enter the following JMESPath string to map users to Grafana roles:
`contains(scope[*], 'healthwatch.admin') && 'Admin' || contains(scope[*], 'healthwatch.edit') && 'Editor' || contains(scope[*], 'healthwatch.read') && 'Viewer'`.

1. (Optional) To prevent users who are not mapped to a valid Grafana role from accessing the Grafana UI, activate the **Deny access to users without Grafana
roles** checkbox. This checkbox is deactivated by default. Deactivating this checkbox assigns the Viewer role to users who cannot be not mapped to a valid
Grafana role by the string configured in the **Role attribute path** field.

1. (Optional) To allow the Grafana instance to communicate with the server for your OAuth provider over TLS:
    1. For **CA certificate for TLS**, provide a certificate for the certificate authority (CA) that the UAA instance with which you want to configure
    authentication uses to verify TLS certificates. You must configure this field if the UAA instance with which you want to configure authentication uses a
    TLS certificate that is signed by an untrusted authority.
    1. If you do not provide a self-signed CA certificate or a certificate that is signed by a self-signed CA certificate, activate the **Skip TLS certificate
    verification** checkbox. When this checkbox is activated, the Grafana instance does not verify the identity of the UAA instance with which you want to
    configure authentication. This checkbox is deactivated by default. VMware does not recommend skipping TLS certificate verification to a UAA instance for a
    runtime on a different Tanzu Operations Manager foundation.

1. Click **Save**.
