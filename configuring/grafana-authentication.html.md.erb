This topic describes how to configure different authentication methods for users to log in
to the Grafana UI.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of Grafana Authentication

By default, users log in to the Grafana UI using basic authentication. With basic authentication,
all users log in to the Grafana UI using the username `admin` and the admin login credentials
found in the **Credentials** tab of the Healthwatch tile.

However, you can configure the Grafana UI to use a different authentication method instead.
This allows users to use their own credentials to log in to the Grafana UI.

The sections in this topic describe how to configure different authentication methods for users
to log in to the Grafana UI:

* Basic authentication. For more information, see [Configure Basic Authentication](#configure-basic-auth)
below.

* Generic OAuth. For more information, see [Configure Generic OAuth Authentication](#configure-generic-oauth)
below.

* User Account and Authentication (UAA). For more information, see [Configure UAA Authentication]
(#configure-uaa) below.

* LDAP. For more information, see [Configure LDAP Authentication](#configure-ldap) below.

For a list of Grafana-supported authentication integrations, see the [Grafana documentation]
(https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/).

The values that you configure in the **Grafana** pane also configure their corresponding properties
in the Grafana configuration file. For more information, see [Overview of Configuration Files
in Healthwatch](config-file-reference.html#overview) in _Configuration File Reference Guide_,
[Configuring the Grafana Configuration File](config-file-reference.html#grafana) in _Configuration
File Reference Guide_, and the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/).


## <a id='configure-basic-auth'></a> Configure Basic Authentication

When you configure basic authentication for the Grafana UI, all users log in to the Grafana
UI using the username `admin` and the login password found in the **Credentials** tab of the
Healthwatch tile.

To configure basic authentication and obtain the login password for the Grafana UI:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.

1. Select **Grafana**.

1. Under **Grafana UI authentication method**, select **Basic authentication**.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.

1. In the **Admin Login Password** row of the **Grafana** section, click **Link to Credential**.

1. Record the value of `password`. This value is the password that all users must use to log
in to the Grafana UI.


## <a id='configure-generic-oauth'></a> Configure Generic OAuth Authentication

When you configure generic OAuth authentication for the Grafana UI, users can log in to the
Grafana UI with their credentials for the Grafana-supported OAuth provider of your choice.
For more information about configuring generic OAuth authentication, see the [Grafana documentation]
(https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/generic-oauth/).

To configure generic OAuth authentication for the Grafana UI:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.

1. Select **Grafana**.

1. Under **Grafana UI authentication method**, select **Generic OAuth**.

1. For **Provider name**, enter the name of your OAuth provider.

1. For **Client ID**, enter the client ID of your OAuth provider. The method to retrieve this
client ID differs depending on your OAuth provider. To find the client ID of your OAuth provider,
see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/).

1. For **Client secret**, enter the client secret of your OAuth provider. The method to retrieve
this client secret differs depending on your OAuth provider. To find the client secret of your
OAuth provider, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/).

1. For **Scopes**, enter a comma-separated list of scopes that the OAuth provider adds to the
user's token when they log in to the Grafana UI. These scopes differ depending on your OAuth
provider. To find the scopes for your OAuth provider, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/).

1. For **Authorization URL**, enter the authorization URL of the server for your OAuth provider.

1. For **Token URL**, enter the token URL of the server for your OAuth provider.

1. For **API URL**, enter the API URL of the server for your OAuth provider.

1. (Optional) For **Email attribute**, enter the attribute that contains the email address
of the user. For more information, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/generic-oauth/).

1. For **Grafana domain**, enter the domain of the Grafana instance. You must configure this
field if your OAuth provider requires a callback URL that uses the root URL of the Grafana
instance. If your OAuth provider does not require a callback URL, do not configure this field.

1. To allow new users to create a new Grafana account when they log in with their existing
OAuth credentials for the first time, activate the **Allow new accounts with existing OAuth
credentials** checkbox. This checkbox is activated by default. Deactivating this checkbox prevents
users without a pre-existing Grafana account from creating a new Grafana account or logging
in to the Grafana UI with their existing OAuth credentials.

1. (Optional) For **Allowed domains**, enter a comma-separated list of domains. Configuring
this field limits Grafana UI access to users who belong to one or more of the listed domains.

1. For **Allowed teams**, enter a comma-separated list of teams. Configuring this field limits
Grafana UI access to users who belong to one or more of the listed teams. Configure this field
if your OAuth provider allows you to separate users into teams. If your OAuth provider does
not allow you to separate users into teams, do not configure this field.

1. For **Allowed organizations**, enter a comma-separated list of orgs. Configuring this field
limits Grafana UI access to users who belong to one or more of the listed orgs. Configure this
field if your OAuth provider allows you to separate users into orgs. If your OAuth provider
does not allow you to separate users into orgs, do not configure this field.

1. For **Allowed groups**, enter a comma-separated list of groups. Configuring this field limits
Grafana UI access to users who belong to one or more of the listed groups. Configure this field
if your OAuth provider allows you to separate users into groups. If your OAuth provider does
not allow you to separate users into groups, do not configure this field.

1. (Optional) To allow the Grafana instance to communicate with the server for your OAuth provider
over TLS:
  1. For **Certificate and private key for TLS**, provide a certificate and private key for
  the Grafana instance to use for TLS connections to the server for your OAuth provider.
  1. For **CA certificate for TLS**, provide a certificate for the certificate authority (CA)
  that the server for your OAuth provider uses to verify TLS certificates.
  1. If you do not provide a self-signed CA certificate or a certificate that is signed by
  a self-signed CA certificate, activate the **Skip TLS certificate verification** checkbox.
  When this checkbox is activated, the Grafana instance does not verify the identity of the
  server for your OAuth provider. This checkbox is deactivated by default.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='configure-uaa'></a> Configure UAA Authentication

When you configure UAA authentication for the Grafana UI, users can log in to the Grafana UI
with their credentials for the UAA instance of the runtime that is installed on the same foundation
as the Healthwatch tile, either VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) or Tanzu
Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI).

To configure UAA authentication for the Grafana UI:

1. Create a new UAA client for the Grafana instance. For more information, see [Create a UAA
Client for the Grafana Instance](#create-uaa-client) below.

1. Configure the `grafana` UAA client in the Healthwatch tile. For more information, see [Configure
the UAA Client in Healthwatch](#configure-client) below.

### <a id='create-uaa-client'></a> Create a UAA Client for the Grafana Instance

To facilitate UAA authentication, the Grafana instance must access the UAA instance for your
runtime through a UAA client.

To create a UAA client for the Grafana instance:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **VMware Tanzu Application Service** or **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition**
tile, depending on which runtime is installed on your foundation.

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.

1. View and record the credentials to log in to the UAA instance for your runtime:
    * For TAS for VMs:
        1. In the **Admin Client Credentials** row of the **UAA** section, click **Link to
        Credential**.
        1. Record the value of `password`. This value is the secret for **Admin Client Credentials**.
    * For TKGI:
        1. In the **Pks Uaa Management Admin Client** row, click **Link to Credential**.
        1. Record the value of `secret`. This value is the secret for **Pks Uaa Management
        Admin Client**.

1. Target the server for the UAA instance for your runtime using the User Account and Authentication
Command Line Interface (UAAC). Run:

    ```
    uaac target UAA-URL
    ```
    Where `UAA-URL` is the URL of the UAA server for your runtime. For TAS for VMs, this URL
    is usually `https://login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`, where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the domain you configured
    in the **System domain** field in the **Domains** pane of the TAS for VMs tile. For TKGI,
    this URL is usually `https://TKGI-API-URL:8443`, where `TKGI-API-URL` is the URL of the
    TKGI API.
    <br>
    <br>
    For more information about the UAAC, see [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI
    (UAAC)](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/uaa/uaa-user-management.html) in the
    TAS for VMs documentation.

1. Log in to the UAA instance for your runtime by running:

        ```
        uaac token client get admin -s UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET
        ```
        Where `UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET` is the UAA admin client secret you recorded from the
        **Credentials** tab in your runtime tile in a previous step.

1. Create a UAA client for the Grafana instance by running:

    ```
    uaac client add grafana \
       --scope openid,healthwatch.admin,healthwatch.edit,healthwatch.read \
       --secret CLIENT-SECRET \
       --authorities uaa.resource \
       --authorized_grant_types authorization_code \
       --redirect_uri PROTOCOL://GRAFANA-ROOT-URL/login/generic_oauth
    ```
    Where:
    * `CLIENT-SECRET` is the secret you want to set for the UAA client.
    * `PROTOCOL` is either `http` or `https`, depending on the protocol you configured the
    Grafana instance to use in the **Grafana** pane of the Healthwatch tile.
    * `GRAFANA-ROOT-URL` is the root URL for the Grafana instance that you use to access the
    Grafana UI.

1. If you are using TKGI, you must manually create UAA user groups to map to administrator,
editor, and viewer permissions for Grafana. Run:

    ```
    uaac group add healthwatch.admin
    uaac group add healthwatch.edit
    uaac group add healthwatch.read
    ```
    If you are using TAS for VMs, you added the UAA client to UAA user groups mapped to administrator,
    editor, and viewer permissions for Grafana in the previous step. Continue to the next step.

1. Create a user account for the UAA client you created in a previous step to log in to the
Grafana instance. Run:

    ```
    uaac user add USERNAME -p SECRET --emails EMAIL
    ```
    Where:
    * `USERNAME` is the username you want to set for the user account.
    * `SECRET` is the secret you want to set for the user account.
    * `EMAIL` is the email address you want to associate with the user account.

1. Assign user permissions to the user account you created in the previous step by running:

    ```
    uaac member add GROUP USERNAME
    ```
    Where:
    * `GROUP` is either `healthwatch.admin`, `healthwatch.edit`, or `healthwatch.read`. These
    groups map to the `Admin`, `Editor`, and `Viewer` Grafana roles, respectively. For more
    information about the level of access each role provides, see the [Grafana documentation]
    (https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/permissions/organization_roles/#compare-roles).
    * `USERNAME` is the username you set for the user account you created in the previous step.

### <a id='configure-client'></a> Configure the UAA Client in Healthwatch

After you create a UAA client for the Grafana instance, you must configure it in the Healthwatch
tile.

To configure the UAA client for the Grafana instance in Healthwatch:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.

1. Select **Grafana**.

1. Under **Grafana UI authentication method**, select **UAA**.

1. For **Client ID**, enter `grafana`.

1. For **Client secret**, enter the secret you set for the `grafana` UAA client you created
in [Create a UAA Client for the Grafana Instance](#create-uaa-client) above.

1. For **UAA server root URL**, enter `login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`, where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system
domain for your runtime.

1. (Optional) To allow the Grafana instance to communicate with your UAA server over TLS, configure
one of the following options:
  * To configure the Grafana instance to use a self-signed CA certificate or a certificate
  that is signed by a self-signed CA certificate when communicating with your UAA server over
  TLS, provide the CA certificate in **CA certificate for TLS**.
  * If you do not provide a self-signed CA certificate or a certificate that is signed by a
  self-signed CA certificate, activate the **Skip TLS certificate verification** checkbox.
  When this checkbox is activated, the Grafana instance does not verify the identity of your
  UAA server. This checkbox is deactivated by default.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='configure-ldap'></a> Configure LDAP Authentication

When you configure LDAP authentication for the Grafana UI, users can log in to the Grafana
UI with their LDAP credentials. You can also create mappings between LDAP group memberships
and Grafana org user roles. For more information about configuring LDAP authentication, see
the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/auth/ldap/).

To configure LDAP authentication for the Grafana UI:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.
