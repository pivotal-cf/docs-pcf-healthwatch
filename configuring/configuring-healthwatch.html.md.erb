This topic describes how to manually configure and deploy the Healthwatch tile.

To install, configure, and deploy Healthwatch through an automated pipeline, see [Installing,
Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated Pipeline](../installing/automated-pipeline.html).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of Configuring and Deploying Healthwatch

The Healthwatch tile monitors metrics across multiple Ops Manager foundations by scraping metrics
from Healthwatch Exporter tiles installed on each foundation. For more information about the
architecture of the Healthwatch tile, see [Healthwatch Tile](../architecture.html#healthwatch)
in _Healthwatch Architecture_.

After installing Healthwatch, you configure Healthwatch component VMs, including the configuration
files associated with them, through the tile UI. You can also configure errands and system
logging, as well as scale VM instances up or down and configure load balancers for multiple
VM instances.

To configure and deploy the Healthwatch tile:

<div class='note'><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>To quickly deploy the Healthwatch tile to ensure that it deploys successfully before
      you fully configure it, you only need to configure the <strong>Assign AZ and Networks</strong>
      pane.</li>
    <li>If you are using Healthwatch to monitor foundations that are running Tanzu Kubernetes
      Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI), you must configure the <strong>TKGI Cluster
      Discovery Configuration</strong> pane.</li>
  </ul>

## <a id='open-ui'></a> Navigate to the Healthwatch Tile

To navigate to the Healthwatch tile:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.


## <a id='az'></a> Assign AZs and Networks

In the **Assign AZ and Networks** pane, you assign jobs to your AZs and networks.

To configure the **Assign AZ and Networks** pane:

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Under **Place singleton jobs in**, select the first AZ. Ops Manager runs any job with a
single instance in this AZ.

1. Under **Balance other jobs in**, select one or more other AZs. Ops Manager balances instances
of jobs with more than one instance across the AZs that you specify.

1. From the **Network** dropdown, select the runtime network that you created when configuring
the BOSH Director tile.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='prometheus'></a> (Optional) Configure Prometheus

In the **Prometheus Configuration** pane, you configure the Prometheus instance in the Healthwatch
tile to scrape metrics from the Healthwatch Exporter tiles installed on each foundation, as
well as any external services or databases from which you want to collect metrics.

The values that you enter in the fields in the **Prometheus Configuration** pane also define
their corresponding properties in the `scrape_config` and `tls_config` sections of the Prometheus
configuration file. For more information, see [&#60;scrape_config>](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
and [&#60;tls_config>](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config)
in _Configuration_ in the Prometheus documentation.

To configure the **Prometheus Configuration** pane:

1. Select **Prometheus Configuration**.

1. For **Scrape Interval**, specify the frequency at which you want the Prometheus instance
to scrape Prometheus exposition endpoints for metrics. You can enter a value string that specifies
`ns`, `us`, `µs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`. To scrape detailed metrics without consuming too
much storage, VMware recommends using the default value of `15s`, or 15 seconds.

1. (Optional) To configure the Prometheus instance to scrape metrics from the Healthwatch Exporter
tiles installed on other Ops Manager foundations or from external services or databases, configure
additional scrape jobs under **Additional Scrape Config Jobs**. You can configure scrape jobs
for any app or service that exposes metrics using a Prometheus exposition format, such as Concourse
CI. For more information about Prometheus exposition formats, see [Exposition Formats](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/)
in the Prometheus documentation.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Prometheus instance automatically discovers and
    scrapes Healthwatch Exporter tiles that are installed on the same foundation as the Healthwatch
    tile. You do not need to configure scrape jobs for these Healthwatch Exporter tiles. You
    only need to configure scrape jobs for Healthwatch Exporter tiles that are installed on
    other foundations.</p>
  1. Click **Add**.
  1. For **TSDB Scrape job**, provide the configuration YAML for the scrape job you want to
  configure. This job can use any of the properties defined by Prometheus except the `tls_config`
  property. Do not prefix the configuration YAML with a dash. For example:

        ```
        job_name: foundation-1
        metrics_path: /metrics
        scheme: https
        static_configs:
         - targets:
           - "1.2.3.4:9090"
           - "5.6.7.8:9090"
        ```
        For more information, see [&#60;scrape_config>](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
        in _Configuration_ in the Prometheus documentation.
        <div class="note warning"> <strong>Warning:</strong> For the <code>job_name</code>
          property, do not use the following job names:
          <ul>
            <li><code>Healthwatch-view-pas-exporter</code></li>
            <li><code>Healthwatch-view-pks-exporter</code></li>
            <li><code>tsdb</code></li>
            <li><code>grafana</code></li>
            <li><code>pks-master-kube-scheduler</code></li>
            <li><code>pks-master-kube-controller-manager</code></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
  1. (Optional) To enable TLS communication between the Prometheus instance and your external
  service or database:
      1. For **TLS Config Certificate Authority**, provide a certificate authority (CA) that
      signs the certificates you provide in the **TLS Config Certificate and Private Key**
      field below. This CA appears as the `ca_file` property in the `tls_config` section of
      the Prometheus configuration file.
      1. For **TLS Config Certificate and Private Key**, provide at least one certificate and
      private key to enable TLS communication between the Prometheus instance and your external
      service or database. These certificates and private keys appear as the `cert_file` and
      `key_file` properties in the `tls_config` section of the Prometheus configuration file.
      1. For **TLS Config Server Name**, enter the name of the server that facilitates TLS
      communication between the Prometheus instance and your external service or database.
      This server name appears as the `server_name` property in the `tls_config` section of
      the Prometheus configuration file.
      1. If the certificate you provided in the **TLS Config Certificate and Private Key**
      field is signed by a self-signed CA or a certificate that is signed by a self-signed
      CA, enable the **TLS Config Skip SSL Validation** checkbox to skip SSL validation during
      TLS handshakes.

1. For **Chunk Size (Disk) MB**, enter in MB the size that you want to specify for chunks of
free disk. The default value is `6144`. Healthwatch uses this free disk chunk size to calculate
the available disk chunks super value metric (SVM). If you rely on Pivotal Healthwatch v1.8
or earlier for any metrics, the Pivotal Healthwatch integration then uses this SVM to calculate
the `Diego_AvailableFreeChunksDisk` metric. The Pivotal Healthwatch integration sends the `Diego_AvailableFreeChunksDisk`
metric back into Loggregator so third-party nozzles can send it to external destinations, such
as a remote server or external aggregation service. For more information, see [SVM Forwarder
VM - Platform Metrics](../metrics.html#svm-forwarder-platform) and [SVM Forwarder VM - Healthwatch
Component Metrics](../metrics.html#svm-forwarder-components) in _Healthwatch Metrics_.

1. For **Chunk Size (Memory) MB**, enter in MB the size that you want to specify for chunks
of free memory. The default value is `4096`. Healthwatch uses this free memory chunk size to
calculate the available memory chunks SVM. If you rely on Pivotal Healthwatch v1.8 or earlier
for any metrics, the Pivotal Healthwatch integration then uses this SVM to calculate the `Diego_AvailableFreeChunksMemory`
metric. The Pivotal Healthwatch integration sends the `Diego_AvailableFreeChunksMemory` metric
back into Loggregator so third-party nozzles can send it to external destinations, such as
a remote server or external aggregation service. For more information, see [SVM Forwarder
VM - Platform Metrics](../metrics.html#svm-forwarder-platform) and [SVM Forwarder VM - Healthwatch
Component Metrics](../metrics.html#svm-forwarder-components) in _Healthwatch Metrics_.

1. (Optional) For **Static IPs for the Prometheus VM(s)**, enter a comma-separated list of valid static IP addresses that you want to reserve for the Prometheus instance. You must enter a separate IP address for each VM in the Prometheus instance. These IP addresses
must not be within the reserved IP ranges you configured in the BOSH Director tile. To find the IP addresses of the VMs:
    1. Select the **Status** tab.
    1. From the **IPs** column, record the IP addresses of each VM listed in the **TSDB** row.

    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Prometheus instance includes two VMs by default. For more information about viewing or scaling your VMs, see <a href="../resources.html">Healthwatch Components and Resource Requirements</a>.
    </p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='alertmanager'></a> (Optional) Configure Alertmanager

In the **Alertmanager Configuration** pane, you configure alerting for Healthwatch. To configure
alerting for Healthwatch, you configure the alerting rules that Alertmanager follows and the
alert receivers to which Alertmanager sends alerts.

To configure the **Alertmanager Configuration** pane, see [Configuring Alerting](optional-config/alerting.html).


## <a id='grafana'></a> (Optional) Configure Grafana

In the **Grafana Configuration** pane, you configure how users access and authenticate with
the Grafana UI, as well as which dashboards appear in the Grafana UI. For more information
about the Grafana UI as it relates to Healthwatch, see [Healthwatch](../index.html).

The values that you enter in the fields in the **Grafana Configuration** pane also define their
corresponding properties the Grafana configuration file. For more information, see [Configuration]
(https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/) in the Grafana documentation.

To configure the **Grafana Configuration** pane:

1. Select **Grafana Configuration**.

1. (Optional) If you configured generic OAuth or UAA authentication for users to log in to
the Grafana UI, or if you configured alerts through Alertmanager, enter a URL for the Grafana
UI in **Root URL for Grafana**. You must configure this URL to enable a generic OAuth provider
or UAA to redirect users to the Grafana UI. Alertmanager also uses this URL to generate links
to the Grafana UI in alert messages. This URL appears as the `root_url` property in the `[server]`
section of the Grafana configuration file.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Healthwatch v2.1 does not automatically assign a default
    root URL to the Grafana UI. You must manually configure a root URL for the Grafana UI in
    the <strong>Root URL for Grafana</strong> field.</p>
After you deploy the Healthwatch tile for the first time, you must use this root URL and the
public IP address of either a single Grafana VM or the load balancer associated with your Grafana
instance to configure a DNS entry for your Grafana instance in the console for your IaaS. Your
Grafana instance listens on either port `443` or `80`, depending on whether you provide an
SSL certificate in the **Enable HTTPS by providing certificates** field below. For more information
about configuring DNS for your Grafana instance, see [Configuring DNS for Your Grafana Instance]
(dns-configuration.html).

1. Under **Enable HTTP(s) Proxy Settings for Grafana**, choose whether to enable or disable
the Grafana instance to make HTTP and HTTPS proxy requests:
  1. To disable HTTP and HTTPS proxy requests, select **Disabled**. HTTP and HTTPS proxy settings
  are disabled by default.
  1. To configure proxy settings for the Grafana instance:
      1. Select **Enabled**.
      1. For **HTTP Proxy for Grafana**, enter your HTTP proxy server URL. The Grafana instance
      uses this URL as the proxy URL for all HTTP and HTTPS requests except those from hosts
      you configure in the **HTTPS Proxy for Grafana** and **No Proxy for Grafana** fields
      below.
      1. For **HTTPS Proxy for Grafana**, enter your HTTPS proxy server URL. The Grafana instance
      uses this URL as the proxy URL for all HTTPS requests except those from hosts you configure
      in the **No Proxy for Grafana** field below.
      1. For **No Proxy for Grafana**, enter a comma-separated list of the hosts you want to
      exclude from proxying. VMware recommends including `*.bosh` and the range of your internal
      network IP addresses so the Grafana instance can still access the Prometheus instance
      without going though the proxy. For example, `*.bosh,10.0.0.0/8,*.example.com` allows
      the Grafana instance to access all BOSH DNS addresses and all internal network IP addresses
      containing `10.0.0.0/8` or `*.example.com` directly, without going though the proxy.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You only need to configure proxy settings if you
        are deploying Healthwatch in an air-gapped environment and want to configure alert
        channels to external addresses, such as the external Slack webhook.</p>

1. (Optional) For **Static IPs for the Grafana VM(s)**, enter a comma-separated list of valid
static IP addresses that you want to reserve for the Grafana instance. These IP addresses must
not be within the reserved IP ranges you configured in the BOSH Director tile.

1. (Optional) To prevent users from logging in to Grafana UI with basic authentication, including
admin users, clear the **Enable Grafana Login Form** checkbox. This checkbox is enabled by
default.

1. Under **Discover Product Dashboards**, select how you want the Grafana instance to discover
the runtimes in your foundations.
    * **Dynamic:** The Grafana instance creates a dashboard in the Grafana UI for the versions
    of VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) and TKGI that are currently installed
    on your foundations. This option is selected by default.
    * **Manual:** The Grafana instance creates a dashboard in the Grafana UI for the versions
    of TAS for VMs and TKGI you specify in the **TAS Version to Monitor** and **TKGI Version
    to Monitor** fields.
    * **Disabled:** The Grafana instance does not discover or create dashboards in the Grafana
    UI for TAS for VMs or TKGI.

1. (Optional) If you want the Grafana instance to create a dashboard for MySQL, select the
**Enable MySQL dashboards** checkbox. This checkbox is disabled by default.

1. (Optional) If you want the Grafana instance to create a dashboard for VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ
for VMs (Tanzu RabbitMQ), select the **Enable RabbitMQ dashboards** checkbox. This checkbox
is disabled by default.
      <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you select the <strong>Enable RabbitMQ dashboards</strong>
        checkbox, prevent the Tanzu RabbitMQ tile from sending duplicate metrics to the Loggregator
        Firehouse by setting the <strong>Metrics polling interval</strong> field to <code>-1</code>
        in the Tanzu RabbitMQ tile. To configure this field, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/monitor.html#metrics-polling-interval">Tanzu RabbitMQ documentation</a>.</p>

1. (Optional) To enable HTTPS for the Grafana instance, you must provide one or more SSL certificates
in **Enable HTTPS by providing certificates**.
<br>
<br>
VMware recommends also providing a certificate signed by a third-party CA in **CA for SSL certificates**.
You can generate a self-signed certificate using the Ops Manager root CA, but doing so causes
your browser to warn you that your CA is invalid every time you access the Grafana UI.
  * To use a certificate signed by a third-party CA:
      1. For **Enable HTTPS by providing certificates**, provide one or more SSL certificates.
      1. For **CA for SSL certificates**, provide the third-party CA that signs the SSL certificates
      you provided in the previous step.
  * To generate a self-signed certificate from the Ops Manager root CA:
      1. Under **Enable HTTPS by providing certificates**, click **Change**.
      1. Click **Generate RSA Certificate**.
      1. In the **Generate RSA Certificate** pop-up window, enter `*.DOMAIN`, where `DOMAIN`
      is the domain of the DNS entry that you configured for the Grafana instance. For example,
      if the DNS entry you configured for the Grafana instance is `grafana.example.com`, enter
      `*.example.com`. For more information about configuring a DNS entry for the Grafana instance,
      see [Configuring DNS for Your Grafana Instance](dns-configuration.html).
      1. Click **Generate**.
      1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM by following the procedure in [Log In to the Ops Manager
      VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) in
      _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ in the Ops Manager documentation.
      1. Run:

            ```
            cat /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
            ```
      1. Record the Ops Manager root CA.
      1. For **Enable HTTPS by providing certificates**, provide the Ops Manager root CA that
      you recorded in the previous step.

1. (Optional) To configure an additional cipher suite for TLS connections to the Grafana instance,
enter a comma-separated list of ciphers in **Additional Cipher Suite Support**. For a list
of supported cipher suites, see [cipher_suites.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c847589ad06a1acfcceaac7b230c0d5a826caab8/src/crypto/tls/cipher_suites.go#L500-L522)
in the Go repository on GitHub.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='canary'></a> (Optional) Configure Canary URLs

In the **Canary URL Configuration** pane, you configure target URLs to which the Blackbox Exporters
in the Prometheus instance sends canary tests. Testing a canary target URL allows you to gauge
the overall health and accessibility of an app, runtime, or deployment.

The **Canary URL Configuration** pane configures the Blackbox Exporters in the Prometheus instance.
For more information, see the [Blackbox exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter)
repository on GitHub.

To configure the **Canary URL Configuration** pane:

1. Select **Canary URL Configuration**.

1. For **Exporter Port**, specify the port that the Blackbox Exporter exposes to the Prometheus
instance. The default port is `9115`. You do not need to specify a different port unless port `9115`
is already in use on the Prometheus instance.

1. (Optional) For **Ops Manager URL**, enter the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your
Ops Manager deployment. This creates a canary target URL that allows the Blackbox Exporter
to test whether the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard is accessible. The results from these
canary tests appear in the **Ops Manager Health** dashboard in the Grafana UI.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you have SAML authentication enabled for Ops Manager,
    enter <code>https<span>:</span>//OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/info</code>, where <code>OPS-MANAGER-FQDN</code>
    is the FQDN of your your Ops Manager deployment. Otherwise, the canary test fails.</p>

1. (Optional) If your Ops Manager deployment uses self-signed certificates, enable the **Skip
Ops Manager SSL Validation** checkbox. Enabling this checkbox allows the Prometheus instance
to communicate with your Ops Manager deployment.

1. (Optional) Under **Target URLs**, you can configure canary target URLs. The Prometheus instance
runs continuous canary tests to these URLs and records the results. To configure canary target
URLs:
  1. Click **Add**.
  1. For **HTTP(S) URL**, enter the URL to which you want the Prometheus instance to send canary
  tests. VMware recommends including `apps.sys.FOUNDATION-URL` if you have TAS for VMs installed,
  or `api.pks.FOUNDATION-URL:8443` if you have TKGI installed, where `FOUNDATION-URL` is the
  root URL of your foundation.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The Prometheus instance automatically creates scrape
    jobs for these URLs. You do not need to create additional scrape jobs for them in the <strong>Prometheus
    Configuration</strong> pane.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='remote-write'></a> (Optional) Configure Remote Write

In the **Remote Write Configuration** pane, you can configure the Prometheus instance to write
to remote storage, in addition to its local time series database (TSDB). Healthwatch stores
monitoring data for six weeks before deleting it. Configuring remote write enables Healthwatch
to store data that is older than six weeks in a remote database or storage endpoint. For a
list of compatible remote databases and storage endpoints, see [Remote Endpoints and Storage]
(https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage) in _Integrations_
in the Prometheus documentation.

The values that you enter in the fields in the **Remote Write Configuration** pane also define
their corresponding properties in the `remote_write` section of the Prometheus configuration
file. For more information, see [&#60;remote_write>](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write)
in _Configuration_ in the Prometheus documentation.

To configure the **Remote Write Configuration** pane:

1. Select **Remote Write Configuration**.

1. Click **Add**.

1. For **URL**, enter the URL for your remote storage endpoint. For example, `https://REMOTE-STORAGE-FQDN`,
where `REMOTE-STORAGE-FQDN` is the FQDN of your remote storage endpoint.

1. In **Remote Timeout (seconds)**, enter in seconds the amount of time that the Prometheus
VM must try to make a request to the remote storage endpoint before the request fails.

1. (Optional) To enable the Prometheus instance to write to your storage endpoint using basic
authentication:
  1. For **Basic Auth Username**, enter the username that the Prometheus instance uses to log
  in to your remote storage endpoint.
  1. For **Basic Auth Password**, enter the password that the Prometheus instance uses to log
  in to your remote storage endpoint.

1. (Optional) To enable TLS communication between the Prometheus instance and your remote storage
endpoint:
  1. For **TLS Config Certificate Authority**, provide a CA that signs the certificates you
  provide in the **TLS Config Certificate and Private Key** field below. This CA appears as
  the `ca_file` property in the `tls_config` section of the `remote_write` configuration.
  1. For **TLS Config Certificate and Private Key**, provide at least one certificate and private
  key to enable TLS communication between the Prometheus instance and your remote storage endpoint.
  These certificates and private keys appear as the `cert_file` and `key_file` properties in
  the `tls_config` section of the `remote_write` configuration.
  1. For **TLS Config Server Name**, enter the name of the server that facilitates TLS communication
  between the Prometheus instance and your remote storage endpoint. This server name appears
  as the `server_name` property in the `tls_config` section of the `remote_write` configuration.
  1. If the certificate you provided in the **TLS Config Certificate and Private Key** field
  is signed by a self-signed CA or a certificate that is signed by a self-signed CA, enable
  the **TLS Config Skip SSL Validation** checkbox to skip SSL validation during TLS handshakes.

1. (Optional) To enable the Prometheus instance to make HTTP or HTTPS proxy requests to the
remote storage endpoint, enter a proxy URL in **Proxy URL**.

1. You can configure more granular settings for writing to your remote storage endpoint by
specifying additional parameters for the shards containing in-memory queues that read from
the write-ahead log (WAL) in the Prometheus instance. The following fields configure the `queue_config`
section of the remote write configuration:
  1. For **Queue Capacity**, enter how many samples the remote storage endpoint can queue in
  memory per shard before the Prometheus instance blocks the queue from reading from the WAL.
  This number appears as the `capacity` property in the `queue_config` section of the remote
  write configuration.
  1. For **Maximum Number of Shards**, enter the maximum number of shards the Prometheus instance
  can use for each remote write queue. This number appears as the `max_shards` property in
  the `queue_config` section of the remote write configuration.
  1. For **Minimum Number of Shards**, enter the minimum number of shards the Prometheus instance
  can use for each remote write queue. This number is also the number of shards the Prometheus
  VM uses when remote write begins after each deployment of the Healthwatch tile. This number
  appears as the `min_shards` property in the `queue_config` section of the remote write configuration.
  1. For **Maximum Number of Samples Per Send**, enter the maximum number of samples the Prometheus
  VM can send to a shard at a time. This number appears as the `max_samples_per_send` property
  in the `queue_config` section of the remote write configuration.
  1. For **Batch Send Deadline (seconds)**, enter in seconds the maximum amount of time the
  Prometheus instance can wait before sending a batch of samples to a shard, whether that shard
  has reached the limit configured in **Maximum Number of Samples Per Send** or not. This number
  appears as the `batch_send_deadline` property in the `queue_config` section of the remote
  write configuration.
  1. For **Minimum Backoff Time (milliseconds)**, enter in milliseconds the minimum amount
  of time the Prometheus instance can wait before retrying a failed request to the remote storage
  endpoint. This number appears as the `min_backoff` property in the `queue_config` section
  of the remote write configuration.
  1. For **Maximum Retry Delay (milliseconds)**, enter in milliseconds the maximum amount of
  time the Prometheus instance can wait before retrying a failed request to the remote storage
  endpoint. This number appears as the `max_backoff` property in the `queue_config` section
  of the remote write configuration.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='tkgi-cluster-discovery'></a> (Optional) Configure TKGI Cluster Discovery

In the **TKGI Cluster Discovery Configuration** pane, you configure TKGI cluster discovery
for Healthwatch. You only need to configure this pane if you have foundations with TKGI installed.

To configure TKGI cluster discovery, see [Configuring TKGI Cluster Discovery](optional-config/configuring-cluster-discovery.html).


## <a id='errands'></a> (Optional) Configure Errands

Errands are scripts that Ops Manager runs automatically when it installs or uninstalls a product,
such as a new version of Healthwatch. There are two types of errands: _post-deploy errands_
run after the product is installed, and _pre-delete errands_ run before the product is uninstalled.
However, there are no pre-delete errands for Healthwatch.

By default, Ops Manager always runs all errands.

In the **Errands** pane, you can select **On** to always run an errand or **Off** to never
run it.

For more information about how Ops Manager manages errands, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager]
(https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/managing_errands.html) in the Ops Manager documentation.

To configure the **Errands** pane:

1. Select **Errands**.

1. (Optional) Choose whether to always run or never run the following errands:
    * **Smoke Test Errand:** Verifies that the Grafana and Prometheus instances are running.
    * **Update Grafana Admin Password:** Updates the admin password for the Grafana UI.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='syslog'></a> (Optional) Configure Syslog

In the **Syslog** pane, you can configure system logging in Healthwatch to forward log messages
from Healthwatch component VMs to an external destination for troubleshooting, such as a remote
server or external syslog aggregation service.

To configure the **Syslog** pane:

1. Select **Syslog**.

1. Under **Do you want to configure Syslog forwarding?**, select one of the following options:
    * **No, do not forward Syslog:** Disables syslog forwarding.
    * **Yes:** Enables syslog forwarding and allows you to edit the configuration fields described
    below.

1. For **Address**, enter the IP address or DNS domain name of your external destination.

1. For **Port**, enter a port on which your external destination listens.

1. For **Transport Protocol**, select **TCP** or **UDP** from the dropdown. This determines
which transport protocol Healthwatch uses to forward system logs to your external destination.

1. (Optional) To transmit logs over TLS:
  1. Select the **Enable TLS** checkbox. This checkbox is disabled by default.
  1. For **Permitted Peer**, enter either the name or SHA1 fingerprint of the remote peer.
  1. For **SSL Certificate**, enter the SSL certificate for your external destination.

1. (Optional) For **Queue Size**, specify the number of log messages Healthwatch can hold in
a buffer at a time before sending them to your external destination. The default value is `100000`.

1. (Optional) To forward debug logs to your external destination, enable the **Forward Debug
Logs** checkbox. This checkbox is disabled by default.

1. (Optional) To specify a custom syslog rule, enter it in **Custom rsyslog configuration**
in RainerScript syntax. For more information about custom syslog rules, see [Customizing Platform
Log Forwarding](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/custom-syslog-rules.html)
in the TAS for VMs documentation. For more information about RainerScript syntax, see the [rsyslog]
(https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/rainerscript/index.html) documentation.

1. Click **Save Syslog Settings**.


## <a id='resource-config'></a> (Optional) Configure Resources

In the **Resource Config** pane, you can scale Healthwatch component VMs up or down according
to the needs of your deployment, as well as associate load balancers with a group of VMs. For
example, you can scale the persistent disk size of the Prometheus instance to enable longer
data retention.

To configure the **Resource Config** pane:

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. (Optional) To scale a job, select an option from the dropdown for the resource you want
to modify:
    * **Instances:** Configures the number of instances each job has.
    * **VM Type:** Configures the type of VM used in each instance.
    * **Persistent Disk Type:** Configures the amount of persistent disk space to allocate
    to the job.

1. (Optional) To add a load balancer to a job:
  1. Click the icon next to the job name.
  1. For **Load Balancers**, enter the name of your load balancer.
  1. Ensure that the **Internet Connected** checkbox is disabled. Enabling this checkbox gives
  VMs a public IP address that enables outbound Internet access.

1. Click **Save**.
