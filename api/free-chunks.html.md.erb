title: Configuring Free Chunk Memory
owner: PCF Healthwatch
---

This topic describes how to use the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch API to retrieve and configure [Available Free Chunks of Memory configurations](../metrics.html#free-memory-chunks).

Currently, two main types of free chunk configurations are supported: Global and Deployment-specific. Through this API, consumers can do the following:

- View current free chunk configurations
- Update the Global free chunk size
- Create deployment-specific free chunk configurations
  - Applicable for customers isolating Compute (Diego Cells) into Isolation Segments, where different threshold values of concern may be needed

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites and Assumptions

The steps in this document assume you can generate bearer tokens for a UAA client with the `healthwatch.read` (`GET` only) and `healthwatch.admin` (both `GET` and `POST`) scopes. For detailed instructions on how to add these scopes, refer to the [Allow Additional Users to Access the PCF Healthwatch UI](../installing.html#healthwatch-uaa-users) documentation.

## <a id='info'></a>Healthwatch API Status

Test the availability of the Healthwatch API by hitting the `/info` endpoint with a simple `GET` request:

```
curl -G healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/info
```

The expected response is a `200`/`OK` with the message `"PCF Healthwatch available"`.

## <a id='get'></a>View all free chunk configurations
### `GET /v1/free-chunks`

To view a list of free chunk configurations, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/free-chunks` endpoint:

```
curl -G healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/free-chunks \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_TOKEN"
```

This returns a JSON array of free chunk configurations:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "deployment": "healthwatch-default",
    "value": 2048
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "deployment": "cf",
    "value": 4096
  }
]
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: the value returned in the PCF Healthwatch API is in megabytes, but the PCF Healthwatch UI displays the value in gigabytes.</p>

## <a id='post'></a>Creating and updating free chunk configurations

### `POST /v1/free-chunks`

To create or update a free chunk configuration, make a `POST` request to the `/v1/free-chunks` endpoint with the following structure:

```
curl "healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/free-chunks"  \
      --data "{\"value\":8192, \"deployment\":\"prod-isolation-segment\"}" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

The `value` property is required. If the `deployment` property is omitted, the global free chunk configuration is updated.

Possible successful HTTP response codes:

- 200: A record was updated
- 201: A new record was created
