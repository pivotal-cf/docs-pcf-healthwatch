This topic describes how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Before deploying PCF Healthwatch, ensure that you have installed:

* PCF Ops Manager v1.11.0 or later
* PCF Elastic Runtime v1.11.0 or later
* the [UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac)

##<a id='install'></a> Install PCF Healthwatch

1. Download the product and supporting files from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-healthwatch).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the main product file. 

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of PCF Healthwatch.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

##<a id='configure'></a> Configure the PCF Healthwatch BOSH Director Health Check

To start using PCF Healthwatch, add a service network to the Ops Manager Director tile and the PCF Healthwatch tile.  This is the subnet on which the PCF Healthwatch Tile will run the BOSH health checks.
This needs to be a Service Network so that Ops Manager will not attempt to use the same IP address as the BOSH Health Check VM.

###<a id='ops-man'></a> Step 1. Configure the Ops Manager Director Tile

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have already completed this step during a prior installation of PCF Healthwatch, it does not need to be repeated.</p>

To configure Ops Manager Director:

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Create Networks** and click **Add Network**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter `bosh-health-check`.
1. Select the **Service Network** checkbox.
1. Enter the network details for your Service Network in the rest of the fields.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.


###<a id='ops-man'></a> Step 3. Configure the PCF Healthwatch Tile

To configure PCF Healthwatch:

1. Click the **PCF Healthwatch** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Health Check** and do the following:

	1. Enter **Ops Manager URL**. The URL should include the protocol.
	1. Enter `bosh-health-check` in **BOSH Healthcheck Service Network**.
	1. Enter an availability zone from your Service Network in **BOSH Healthcheck Availability Zone**.
	1. Enter a VM type in **BOSH Healthcheck VM Type**.
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can find the availability zone and VM type values by submitting the <code>YOUR-OPSMAN-URL/api/v0/deployed/cloud_config</code> Ops Manager API request.</p>
	1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.

##<a id='bosh-metrics'></a> Getting BOSH Health Metrics into PCF Healthwatch

Forwarding BOSH health metrics to PCF Healthwatch currently requires manual configuration. You must have PCF Admin permissions to configure the BOSH Director.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The manual configuration is required for the alpha and beta releases of PCF Healthwatch.</p>

To configure the BOSH Director, follow the instructions below. The referenced plugins are available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-healthwatch).

1. Copy `healthwatch-bosh-plugin`, `run.sh`, and `healthwatch-bosh-plugin.json` to the BOSH Director.
1. Move `healthwatch-bosh-plugin` to `/var/vcap/packages/healthwatch/`.
1. Assign the `-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root`(chmod 755) permissions to `/var/vcap/packages/healthwatch/healthwatch-bosh-plugin`.
1. Move `run.sh` to `/var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/bin/bosh-monitor/`.
1. Assign the `-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root`(chmod 755) permissions to `/var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/bin/bosh-monitor/run.sh`.
1. Move `healthwatch.json` to `/var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/`.
1. Assign the `-rw-r--r-- 1 root root`(chmod 644) permissions to `/var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/healthwatch.json`.
1. Edit and update the `/var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/healthwatch.json` file with your MySQL IP and credentials.
1. Create a folder in `/var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/`.
1. Assign the `drwxr-x--- 2 vcap vcap`(chmod 750) permissions to `/var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/`.
1. Verify that `healthwatch-bosh-plugin.json` is enabled in `/var/vcap/jobs/health_monitor/config/health_monitor.yml`.
1. Run `monit restart health_monitor` and verify that logs are created in `/var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/`.

See the commands below:

<pre class="terminal">
sudo -i
mkdir -p /var/vcap/packages/healthwatch/
mkdir -p /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/bin/bosh-monitor/
mkdir -p /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/
mkdir -p /var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/

mv /tmp/healthwatch-bosh-plugin /var/vcap/packages/healthwatch/
mv /tmp/run.sh /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/bin/bosh-monitor/
mv /tmp/healthwatch.json /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/
chown vcap:vcap /var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/
chmod +x /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/bin/bosh-monitor/run.sh
chmod +x /var/vcap/packages/healthwatch/healthwatch-bosh-plugin
</pre>

##<a id='uaa-authorities'></a> Configure UAA Authorities

To configure UAA authorities, run the `configure_uaa.sh` script from your terminal. This script configures the UAA client credentials that are needed for the PCF Healthwatch UI to access a token on behalf of your login user.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must have PCF Admin permissions to configure UAA authorities.</p>

You can find the contents of the script below:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash


UAA_URL=$1  #The URL of the UAA login like login.sys.valentino.gcp.pcf-metrics.com.
UAA_ADMIN_USERNAME=$2 #The UAA admin client credentials username.
UAA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$3 #The UAA admin client credentials password.
NEW_CLIENT=$4 #The client credentials username provided in Ops Manager for the Healthwatch application.
NEW_CLIENT_SECRET=$5 #The client credentials secret provided in Ops Manager for Healthwatch.
UAA_USER=$6 #The user you want to log in to Healthwatch with. They will get the platform-monitoring.read scope.
APP_URL=$7 #The full URL of the Healthwatch application.

echo $UAA_URL
echo $UAA_ADMIN_USERNAME
echo $NEW_CLIENT
echo $UAA_USER
echo $APP_URL

uaac target $UAA_URL --skip-ssl-validation
uaac token client get $UAA_ADMIN_USERNAME -s $UAA_ADMIN_PASSWORD
uaac group add platform_monitoring.read || true

uaac client add $NEW_CLIENT \
   --authorities "uaa.resource" \
   --scope "platform_monitoring.read" \
   --authorized_grant_types "authorization_code,refresh_token" \
   -s $NEW_CLIENT_SECRET \
   --redirect_uri $APP_URL \
   --access_token_validity 900 \
   --refresh_token_validity 2628000 \
   --autoapprove true

uaac member add platform_monitoring.read $UAA_USER
```
See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">$ ./configure_uaa.sh login.sys.valentino.gcp.pcf-metrics.com admin UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET platform_monitoring PLATFORM_MONITORING-SECRET admin PCF-HEALTHWATCH-URL</pre>

In this example, replace `login.sys.valentino.gcp.pcf-metrics.com` with the URL of your UAA login. `PLATFORM_MONITORING-SECRET` is the password that you enter in Ops Manager when configuring the PCF Healthwatch tile.
